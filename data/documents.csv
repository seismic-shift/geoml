Uranium Measurement By Airborne Gamma‐Ray Spectrometry,"In the airborne measurement of uranium, window type gamma‐ray spectrometers are used and it is necessary to correct for scattered high energy radiation from thallium 208 in the thorium decay series. This radiation can be scattered in the crystal, in the ground, and in the air. A theory, analogous to the theory of radioactive decay, is developed; it can adequately explain the spectrum buildup in the uranium window for a point source of thorium oxide immersed to different depths in water and for a detector above the water. The theory is extended to predict the buildup as a function of altitude for detectors of different sizes and shows that errors in the airborne measurement of uranium can be, significant if no allowance is made for radiation scattered in the ground and in the air.",10.1190/1.1440542
Coupling In Amplitude Variation With Offset And The Wiggins Approximation,"Linear amplitude-variation-with-offset (AVO) approximations, which experience a reduction in accuracy as elastic parameter contrasts become large, may be adjusted with second- and higher-order corrections. Corrective terms can be expressed in many ways, but they only serve a meaningful purpose if they provide the same qualitative interpretability as did the linearization. Some aspects of nonlinear AVO can be understood, quantitatively and qualitatively, in terms of coupling — the interdependence of elastic parameter contrasts amongst themselves in their determination of reflection strengths. Coupling, for instance, explains the weak but nonnegligible dependence of the converted wave reflection coefficient on the lower half-space P-wave velocity. This fact can be exposed by expanding the solutions of the Zoeppritz equations in a particular hierarchy of series. Also explainable through this approach is the mathematical importance of what is sometimes referred to as the ""Wiggins approximation,"" under which VP/VS=2. This special number is seen to coincide with a full decoupling of density contrasts from VP and VS contrasts at the second order. The decoupling persists across several variations of the nonlinear AVO approximations, including both expressions in terms of the relative changes ΔVP/VP, ΔVS/VS, and Δρ/ρ, and expressions in terms of single-parameter reflectivities.",10.1190/geo2012-0429.1
Principal Component Spectral Analysis,"Spectral decomposition methods help illuminate lateral changes in porosity and thin-bed thickness. For broadband data, an interpreter might generate 80 or more somewhat redundant amplitude and phase spectral components spanning the usable seismic bandwidth at   1-Hz   intervals. Large numbers of components can overload not only the interpreter but also the display hardware. We have used principal component analysis to reduce the multiplicity of spectral data and enhance the most energetic trends inside the data. Each principal component spectrum is mathematically orthogonal to other spectra, with the importance of each spectrum being proportional to the size of its corresponding eigenvalue. Principal components are ideally suited to identify geologic features that give rise to anomalous moderate- to high-amplitude spectra. Unlike the input spectral magnitude and phase components, the principal component spectra are not direct indicators of bed thickness. By combining the variability of multiple components, principal component spectra highlight stratigraphic features that can be interpreted using a seismic geomorphology workflow. By mapping the three largest principal components using the three primary colors of red, green, and blue, we could represent more than 80% of the spectral variance with a single image. We have applied and validated this workflow using a broadband data volume containing channels draining an unconformity, which was acquired over the Central Basin Platform, Texas, U.S.A. Principal component analysis reveals a channel system with only a few output data volumes. The same process provides the interpreter with flexibility to remove any unwanted high-amplitude geologic trends or random noise from the original spectral components by eliminating those principal components that do not aid in delineation of prospective features with their interpretation during the reconstruction process.",10.1190/1.3119264
Extended Arrays For Marine Seismic Acquisition,"In‐line arrays for both source and receiver have been implemented for marine seismic reflection data acquisition. The in‐line array dimensions (variable within limits) are considerably greater than any previously used system of which we are aware. The arrays were designed to attenuate extremely strong sea‐bottom multiples during the data acquisition phase. The source comprised 25 airguns arranged in five identical in‐line subarrays. Each subarray produced a signal of better than 6 barmeters acoustic intensity with a primary‐to‐bubble ratio of approximately 4.4 from guns totaling 297 cu in. When this source was delivered in 1973, it constituted the most powerful production airgun source for which we had seen calibration measurements.  Receiver arrays were implemented by a ""weighting‐mixing"" box (which formed part of the DFS IV instrument), the input to which comprised 53 channels of data each from a 50 m live section in the streamer cable. Processing techniques which are complementary to the field procedures have been developed.  Comparisons with ""conventional"" data (and such data processed to simulate field arrays) show significant improvements in ""data quality"" from the new field techniques, that is, the new data are easier to interpret geologically because interfering multiples have been attenuated relative to desired energy. Whilst the large outgoing signal amplitude will have made some contribution to the data quality, the major improvement is believed to result from the use of arrays in the recording phase. This system, first used for production in August 1973, was subsequently used successfully during recording of 17,000 km of offshore seismic data from Eastern Canada, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean.",10.1190/1.1440827
Modeling Anisotropic Static Elastic Properties Of Soft Mudrocks With Different Clay Fractions,"We have quantified the effects of clay fraction and fabric on the static elastic properties of soft mudrocks with emphasis on microlevel mechanisms. Soft mudrocks are treated as a mixture of nonclay minerals and clay-water composites. We have devised a simplified approach to estimate the fabric orientation distribution of soft mudrocks based on measured parameters such as clay fraction and porosity. A single parameter (fabric angle) that characterizes the fabric orientation distribution of soft mudrocks is related to the void ratio of clay-water composites. The static transversely isotropic (TI) elastic properties of soft mudrocks are modeled using an anisotropic differential effective medium approach. The effect of variation in fabric orientation distribution on the TI elastic parameters of clay-water composites is studied by applying the Voigt approximation. With an increase of clay fraction, soft mudrocks have decreasing trends in the deformation moduli because some nonclay minerals are replaced by clay-water composites. However, the deformation moduli of clay-water composites could increase when there is more anisotropy in the fabric due to an increase in the clay fraction. Thus, the correlations between anisotropic elastic moduli and volume fraction of clay-water composites will display some fluctuations. Such nonlinear relationships are validated against published experimental data on Colorado shale samples from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.",10.1190/geo2015-0575.1
Bouguer Corrections With Varying Surface Density,"The Bouguer correction is made, as a rule, to sea level and by using an average density value of the rocks, determined by the profile method. However, if the density of the rocks forming the topography varies from place to place, then the proper density value should be used for every topographical feature. The Bouguer correction with varying density should be made only to a surface drawn through the low points of the topography. Below this surface, and to sea level, a constant density value should be used all over in the area; otherwise, nonexisting gravity anomalies may be introduced into the results of the survey, or existing gravity anomalies may be distorted. A few examples are given for computing Bouguer corrections with varying surface density, and to illustrate the errors introduced by using improper density values.",10.1190/1.1438292
Possible Application Of The Anomalous Free‐Air Vertical Gradient To Marine Exploration,"Recently it could be shown (Thyssen‐Bornemisza, 1965) that a vertical lithologic unit cylinder generates a relatively strong anomalous free‐air vertical gravity gradient F′ along the cylinder axis. The following simple example may serve as a demonstration. A small vertical cylinder made of gold or tungsten, where radius r and length L are identical, would generate the anomalous average gradient F′∼3,223 Eötvös units over the interval h=r=L going from the cylinders top surface upward. Suppose r=l=1 cm, then an average gradient exceeding the earth's normal free‐air vertical gradient F is present over the interval h=1 cm.",10.1190/1.1439745
Hydrologic Trajectories In Transient Ground-Penetrating-Radar Reflection Data,"A variable-rate infiltration experiment was conducted in a sandbox to demonstrate that distinctive patterns are produced in transient ground-penetrating-radar (GPR) data collected during wetting and drying events. The observed GPR response was found to be very consistent with the results of numerical simulations performed using finite-difference time-domain modeling of GPR coupled with a 1D unsaturated flow model (HYDRUS-1D) for which the sand hydraulic properties were determined independently using core samples. Despite this agreement, few methods are available that can efficiently analyze transient GPR data to make a quantitative link between observed responses and the hydraulic properties of soils. To address this problem, a computationally efficient method is proposed that is analogous to coherency analysis used in multioffset surveys. The new method isbased on the calculation of semblance along trajectories through transient GPR data. Each trajectory represents a specific GPR arrival, e.g., the ground wave and reflections from the wetting front and subsurface boundaries. The specific path of the trajectories is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the soil, just as the normal-moveout trajectories used to calculate semblance in multioffset data are controlled by wave velocity. Because the method is based on the output of 1D unsaturated flow models, it can be used for situations with complex hydrologic boundary conditions. Good agreement was found in this study between the calculated trajectories and the arrivals observed for both simulated and empirical GPR data. A sensitivity analysis performed in this study suggests that most parameters of the Mualem–van Genuchten soil model can be identified using this approach to coherency analysis of transient GPR data.",10.1190/1.3463416
The Newmont Drill‐Hole Emp System—Examples From Eastern Australia,"Surface and drill‐hole EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse) surveys are routinely carried out by Newmont in various countries around the world. Results from drill hole EMP surveys on three base metal deposits in New South Wales are presented and discussed. Interpretation of the EMP data is aided by computer modeling of the results to determine location, depth, strike, dip, and quality of conductors. Computer models for all three deposits give excellent agreement with geology and drill intersections.",10.1190/1.1441740
Mapping Of Induced Polarization Using Natural Fields,"The observed electromagnetic response of a finite body is caused by induction and polarization currents in the body and by the distortion of the induction currents in the surrounding medium. At a sufficiently low frequency, there is negligible induction and the measured response is that of the body distorting the background currents just as it would distort a direct current (dc). Because this dc response is not inherently frequency dependent, any observed change in response of the body for frequencies low enough to be in this dc limit must result from frequency‐dependent conductivity. Profiles of low‐frequency natural electric (telluric) fields have spatial anomalies over finite bodies of fixed conductivity that are independent of frequency and have no associated phase anomaly. If the body is polarizable, the electric field profile over the body becomes frequency dependent and phase shifted with respect to a reference field. The technique was tested on data acquired in a standard continuous profiling magnetotelluric (MT) survey over a strong induced polarization (IP) anomaly previously mapped with a conventional pole‐dipole IP survey. The extracted IP response appears in both the apparent resistivity and the normalized electric field profiles.",10.1190/1.1444888
Imaging Complex Geologic Structure With Single‐Arrival Kirchhoff Prestack Depth Migration,"We compare various forms of single‐arrival Kirchhoff prestack depth migration to a full‐waveform, finite‐difference migration image, using synthetic seismic data generated from the structurally complex 2-D Marmousi velocity model. First‐arrival‐traveltime Kirchhoff migration produces severe artifacts and image contamination in regions of the depth model where significant reflection energy propagates as late or multiple arrivals in the total reflection wavefield. Kirchhoff migrations using maximum‐energy‐arrival traveltime trajectories significantly improve the image in the complex zone of the Marmousi model, but are not as coherent as the finite‐difference migration image. By carefully incorporating continuous phase estimates with the associated maximum‐energy arrival traveltimes, we obtain single‐arrival Kirchhoff images that are similar in quality to the finite‐difference migration image. Furthermore, maximum‐energy Green's function traveltime and phase values calculated within the seismic frequency band give a Kirchhoff image that is (1) far superior to a first‐arrival—based image, (2) much better than the analogous high‐frequency paraxial‐ray Green's function image, and (3) closely matched in quality to the full‐waveform finite‐difference migration image.",10.1190/1.1444256
Continuous Sounding‐Profiling With A Dipole‐Dipole Resistivity Array,"Among the different four‐electrode arrays used in resistivity sounding and profiling, the dipole‐dipole array can provide, in some instances, advantages over the more conventional Schlumberger and Wenner configurations. Interpretation of data from Wenner and Schlumberger methods has been described by Compagnie Générale de Géophysique (1955), Mooney and Wetzel (1956), Zohdy (1964), and many others. The primary reason for using a dipole‐dipole array has been to minimize inductive coupling between the transmitting and receiving dipoles when performing frequency‐domain, induced‐polarization surveys (e.g., Marshall and Madden, 1959). This inductive coupling, as effected by the presence of the earth, produces spurious frequency‐dependent voltages in the measuring circuit. Such spurious voltages are small and only of importance when one wishes to calculate the percentage change in resistivity between two frequencies; they are usually much less than the 5 to 10 percent accuracy sought in most resistivity surveys. For this reason, and because the dipole‐dipole array leads to small measured potentials, it is seldom used in single‐frequency resistivity sounding or profiling. However, we shall demonstrate in this paper the manner in which the dipole‐dipole array may be used effectively for simultaneous sounding and profiling.",10.1190/1.1439975
Adaptive Subtraction Using Complex-Valued Curvelet Transforms,"We propose a complex-valued curvelet transform-based (CCT-based) algorithm that adaptively subtracts from seismic data those noises for which an approximate template is available. The CCT decomposes a geophysical data set in terms of small reflection pieces, with each piece having a different characteristic frequency, location, and dip. One can precisely change the amplitude and shift the location of each seismic reflection piece in a template by controlling the amplitude and phase of the template's CCT coefficients. Based on these insights, our approach uses the phase and amplitude of the data's and template's CCT coefficients to correct misalignment and amplitude errors in the noise template, thereby matching the adapted template with the actual noise in the seismic data, reflection event-by-event. We also extend our approach to subtract noises that require several templates to be approximated. By itself, the method can only correct small misalignment errors (  ±5 ms   in   50-Hz   data) in the template; it relies on conventional least-squares (LS) adaptation to correct large-scale misalignment errors, such as wavelet mismatches and bulk shifts. Synthetic and real-data results illustrate that the CCT-based approach improves upon the LS approach and a curvelet-based approach described by Herrmann and Verschuur.",10.1190/1.3453425
Two Representations Of The Fan Filter,"The fan filter is a two‐dimensional (2-D) velocity filter that removes low apparent velocity events from seismic data. The convolutional representation was derived by Embree et al (1963) and by Fail and Grau (1963). Treitel et al (1967) extended the representation to include a recursive realization. Its basic use includes migration dip suppression, multiple suppression, slant stacking, and noise suppression in stacking.",10.1190/1.1441363
A Frequency‐Space 2-D Scalar Wave Extrapolator Using Extended 25-Point Finite‐Difference Operator,"Finite‐difference frequency‐domain modeling for the generation of synthetic seismograms and crosshole tomography has been an active field of research since the 1980s. The generation of synthetic seismograms with the time‐domain finite‐difference technique has achieved considerable success for waveform crosshole tomography and for wider applications in seismic reverse‐time migration. This became possible with the rapid development of high performance computers. However, the space‐frequency (x,ω) finite‐difference modeling technique is still beyond the capability of the modern supercomputer in terms of both cost and computer memory. Therefore, finite‐difference time‐domain modeling is much more popular among exploration geophysicists. A limitation of the space‐frequency domain is that the recently developed nine‐point scheme still requires that G, the number of grid points per wavelength, be 5. This value is greater than for most other numerical modeling techniques (for example, the pseudospectral scheme). To overcome this disadvantage inherent in space‐frequency domain modeling, we propose a new weighted average finite‐difference operator by approximating the spatial derivative and the mass acceleration term of the wave equation. We use 25 grid points around the collocation. In this way, we can reduce the number of grid points so that G is now 2.5. This approaches the Nyquist sampling limit in terms of the normalized phase velocity.",10.1190/1.1444323
Formation Resistivity Variation Due To Steam Flooding: A Log Study,"An investigation of the pre‐ and poststeam resistivity logs, in a production pattern in a heavy‐oil field in Southern California, shows that the formation resistivity in steamed formations decreases by a factor of two to three. Shales as well as sands are affected by the steam flood. The observed drop in the resistivity of the reservoir correlates well with the increase in temperature. The study shows the potential of using resistivity variations to map and monitor thermal enhanced oil recovery process.",10.1190/1.1443264
Estimation Of Primaries By Sparse Inversion From Passive Seismic Data,"For passive seismic data, surface multiples are used to obtain an estimate of the subsurface responses, usually by a crosscorrelation process. This crosscorrelation process relies on the assumption that the surface has been uniformly illuminated by subsurface sources in terms of incident angles and strengths. If this is not the case, the crosscorrelation process cannot give a true amplitude estimation of the subsurface response. Furthermore, cross terms in the crosscorrelation result are not related to actual subsurface inhomogeneities. We have developed a method that can obtain true amplitude subsurface responses without a uniform surface-illumination assumption. Our methodology goes beyond the crosscorrelation process and estimates primaries only from the surface-related multiples in the available signal. We use the recently introduced estimation of primaries by sparse inversion (EPSI) methodology, in which the primary impulse responses are considered to be the unknowns in a large-scale inversion process. With some modifications, the EPSI method can be used for passive seismic data. The output of this process is primary impulse responses with point sources and receivers at the surface, which can be used directly in traditional imaging schemes. The methodology was tested on 2D synthetic data.",10.1190/1.3460431
Seismic Reflection And Ground‐Penetrating Radar Imaging Of A Shallow Aquifer,"In 1995 and 1996, researchers associated with the US Air Force's Phillips and Armstrong Laboratories took part in an extensive geophysical site characterization of the Groundwater Remediation Field Laboratory located at Dover Air Force Base, Dover, Delaware. This field experiment offered an opportunity to compare shallow‐reflection profiling using seismic compressional sources and low‐frequency ground‐penetrating radar to image a shallow, unconfined aquifer. The main target within the aquifer was the sand‐clay interface defining the top of the underlying aquitard at 10 to 14 m depth. Although the water table in a well near the site was 8 m deep, cone penetration geotechnical data taken across the field do not reveal a distinct water table. Instead, cone penetration tests show a gradual change in electrical properties that we interpret as a thick zone of partial saturation. Comparing the seismic and radar data and using the geotechnical data as ground truth, we have associated the deepest coherent event in both reflection data sets with the sand‐clay aquitard boundary. Cone penetrometer data show the presence of a thin lens of clays and silts at about 4 m depth in the north part of the field. This shallow clay is not imaged clearly in the low‐frequency radar profiles. However, the seismic data do image the clay lens. Cone penetrometer data detail a clear change in the soil classification related to the underlying clay aquitard at the same position where the nonintrusive geophysical measurements show a change in image character. Corresponding features in the seismic and radar images are similar along profiles from common survey lines, and results of joint interpretation are consistent with information from geotechnical data across the site.",10.1190/1.1444432
Underground Waste Management And Environmental Implications,"The following is a brief report of the symposium on ""Underground Waste Management and Environmental Implications"" made by the official representative of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. The symposium was held at the Astro World Hotel in Houston, December 6–9, 1971. The approximate final registration was 561. A volume of proceedings will be published by the AAPG at a prepublication price of $18. The complete program for the meeting was published in the AAPG Bulletin, vol. 55, no. 11 (November 1971), p. 2078–2092, which includes abstracts of the papers.",10.1190/1.1440278
Migration From 3D Irregular Surfaces: A Prestack Time Migration Approach,"We have developed a modified 3D prestack time migration (PSTM) scheme that can handle rugged topography as well as high near-surface velocities in land seismic imaging. The proposed topography PSTM can be applied to seismic data recorded on a 3D irregular surface without static corrections. Two effective velocity parameters were found to describe wave propagation through inhomogeneous media above and below a chosen datum. As a result, wave propagation phenomena in the complex near surface, such as near-vertical incidences through a weathering layer and raypaths bending away from vertical in the presence of high near-surface velocities, are correctly considered. The two effective velocity parameters can be estimated by flattening events in imaging gathers. Hence, it is not necessary to have detailed knowledge of the near-surface velocity model and velocity field below the datum when applying topography PSTM. We integrated residual static corrections into topography PSTM. This eliminated the distortions along the events better than conventional residual static corrections, which are usually applied before migration. The computational cost of the topography PSTM was only slightly higher than that of conventional PSTM due to the use of a table-driven algorithm. Three-dimensional synthetic and field data sets were used to test the proposed topography PSTM. High-quality imaging results were obtained.",10.1190/geo2011-0447.1
"Long‐Offset Transient Electromagnetic (Lotem) Depth Soundings Applied To Crustal Studies In The Black Forest And Swabian Alb, Federal Republic Of Germany","The long‐offset transient electromagnetics (LOTEM) sounding method is a valuable complementary technique for deep seismic exploration as applied to earth crustal investigations. During 1986, two LOTEM surveys were conducted to augment completed seismic investigations for crustal studies in southern West Germany, east of the Rhine graben. Our studies were motivated by the geoscientific activities within the framework of the German Continental Deep Drilling (KTB) project. The survey objectives were (1) to determine the applicability of the LOTEM method to crustal geophysics, (2) to investigate the correlation of resistivity anomalies with velocity anomalies, and (3) to confirm the method and interpretation in an area of known geology with existing geophysical data. The Black Forest and the Urach geothermal area survey results exhibit conductive features in the upper 10 km of the crust which were not previously defined by other geophysical data. Importantly, the results demonstrate a very strong correlation of a low‐velocity zone with low electrical resistivity at 5 to 7 km depth within the crystalline basement at both locations.",10.1190/1.1442897
Estimation Of Free Gas Saturation From Seismic Reflection Surveys By The Genetic Algorithm Inversion Of A P-Wave Attenuation Model,"Many previously proposed methods of estimating free gas saturation from seismic survey data rely on calibration to invasively collected, in situ measurements. Typically, such in situ measurements are used to parameterize or calibrate rock-physics models, which can then be applied to seismic data to achieve saturation estimates. We tested a technique for achieving estimates of the spatial distribution of gas saturation solely from shipboard seismic surveys. We estimated the quality factor from seismic reflection surveys using the spectral ratio method, and then inverted a mesoscopic-scale P-wave attenuation model to find the parameters that matched the modeled attenuation to our estimates of observed attenuation within the range of seismic frequencies. By using a genetic algorithm for this inversion, we not only searched efficiently for a global solution to the nonlinear set of equations that compose the model, but also constrain the search to a relatively broad set of realistic parameter values. Thus, our estimates do not rely on in situ measurements of these parameters, but on distributions of their possible values, many of which may be referenced from literature. We first tested this method at Blake Ridge, offshore North and South Carolina, where an approximately 400-m-deep gas-saturated zone underlies a field of methane hydrates. The extensive field work and subsequent studies at this site make it ideal for validating our method. We also demonstrated the applicability of our method to shallower deposits by presenting results from Finneidfjord, Norway, where the inversion of the P-wave attenuation model recognizes very small gas saturations.",10.1190/geo2011-0291.1
A Biological Proof Of Petroleum Emanations,"""It cannot be denied that the chemical‐physical structure of the near surface layers of the earth's crust reflect their physical characteristics and chemical composition in the plant life that covers them, in spite of the many retractions and changes which the science of Botany has had to make in this matter. The fact that many plants and plant components can store up metals has been recognized and utilized by miners and geologists, in that they correlate the occurrence of certain trace elements such as gold and lead in certain plants with corresponding mineral deposits. On the other hand the science of Applied Geophysics has long sought a useful method for proving and possibly determining quantitatively the presence of hydrocarbons which have migrated through the overlying formations to the earth's surface. Hydrocarbons are found almost universally in the earth's crust near the surface layers usually irrespective of whether or not an appreciable deposit of oil exists in the vicinity. For example, methane is formed as the result of the decomposition of organic matter. Evidence of the actual effects of mineral deposits is therefore generally either obscured or cannot be proved.",10.1190/1.1437323
A Bayes Tour Of Inversion: A Tutorial,"It is unclear whether one can (or should) write a tutorial about Bayes. It is a little like writing a tutorial about the sense of humor. However, this tutorial is about the Bayesian approach to the solution of the ubiquitous inverse problem. Inasmuch as it is a tutorial, it has its own special ingredients. The first is that it is an overview; details are omitted for the sake of the grand picture. In fractal language, it is the progenitor of the complex pattern. As such, it is a vision of the whole. The second is that it does, of necessity, assume some ill‐defined knowledge on the part of the reader. Finally, this tutorial presents our view. It may not appeal to, let alone be agreed to, by all.",10.1190/1.1444923
Horizontal Acceleration Corrections In Airborne Gravimetry,"The stabilized platforms used in marine and airborne gravimeters behave like damped long‐period pendulums. When subjected to horizontal accelerations they tilt, resulting in gravimeter reading errors. The amount of tilt depends on the ratio of the period of the horizontal motion to that of the platform and is negligible if this ratio is less than about 0.1 (LaCoste, 1967). This condition can be achieved in straight and level flight using an auto pilot, provided the platform period is set to a sufficiently long period (Brozena and Peters, 1988). Course changes are sometimes unavoidable, however, resulting in lost data (Bell et al., 1991; Brozena, 1984). The aim of this paper is to show that such data loss is unnecessary since the tilt, and hence the gravimeter error, can be accurately modeled from the horizontal accelerations. Moreover the technique will improve data quality whenever long period horizontal accelerations occur. Measuring these accelerations is now straightforward with differential carrier phase GPS.",10.1190/1.1443948
Array Estimators And The Use Of Microseisms For Reconnaissance Of Sedimentary Basins,"A ""natural field"" seismic technique is possible to attain by observing microseisms with a suitably designed array and by digitally processing the data to obtain estimates of the phase velocities of Rayleigh waves. Wavelengths of interest in detecting depth to the basement of sedimentary basins are in the range 2 to 20 km, and correspond to wave periods from 1 to 7 s. An array of five or seven seismometers deployed as an expanding cross configuration simplifies field procedures and is adequate for phase velocity measurements of Rayleigh waves in the required wavelength range, provided high‐resolution frequency‐wavenumber spectral analysis is used. This analysis can be implemented on a minicomputer in the field. Results obtained from observation in a sedimentary basin of known structure show predominantly fundamental‐mode Rayleigh wave propagation. The scatter of velocity estimates is small enough to allow inversion by curve matching, and depth to the basement can be computed to an accuracy of ±30 percent without requiring restrictive assumptions of a seismic velocity structure.",10.1190/1.1441596
High-Resolution Gravity Study Of The Gray Fossil Site,"The Gray Fossil Site, Washington County, Tennessee, has produced a remarkable Mio-Pliocene fauna and flora with no known correlative in the Appalachian region. After its discovery in 2000, a series of auger holes were drilled by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) to determine the areal extent of the site. Drilling indicated that the fossils occurred in fill material within a paleokarst basin, but the distribution of boreholes does not permit details of sinkhole topography, and therefore its formation and fill history, to be adequately resolved. To better image the sinkhole basin, a high-resolution gravity survey, which included 1104 gravity measurement stations, was conducted. These data were used to create complete Bouguer and residual gravity anomaly maps and a 3D density model via inversionmethods. The residual gravity anomaly map compares favorably with 29 TDOT auger holes drilled to basement, but contains significantly more detail. The residual gravity anomaly map reveals the presence of seven separate sinkholes. However, 3D inverse modeling constrained by drill-hole depths and density data indicates that there are 11 separate sinkholes formed within the Knox Group carbonates. These sinkholes, which range between 20 and   44 m   in depth, are aligned along northwest and northeast trending linear features that correlate to structural features formed during the Appalachian orogenies. It is possible that the overall sinkhole basin formed as the result of partial coalescence of multiple sinkhole structures controlled by a joint system and that the sinkholes then acted as a natural trap for the Gray Fossil Site fauna and flora.",10.1190/1.2829987
Recovery Of The Acoustic Impedance From Reflection Seismograms,"This paper examines the problem of recovering the acoustic impedance from a band‐limited normal incidence reflection seismogram. The convolutional model for the seismogram is adopted at the outset, and it is therefore required that initial processing has removed multiples and recovered true amplitudes as well as possible. In the first portion of the paper we investigate the effect of substituting the deconvolved seismic trace (that is, the band‐limited version of the reflectivity function) into the standard recursion formula for the acoustic impedance. The formalism of linear inverse theory is used to show that the logarithm of the normalized acoustic impedance estimated from the deconvolved seismogram is approximately an average of the true logarithm of the impedance. Moreover, the averaging function is identical to that used in deconvolving the initial seismogram. The advantage of these averages is that they are unique; their disadvantage is that low‐frequency information, which is crucial to making a geologic interpretation, is missing. We next present two methods by which the missing low‐frequency information can be recovered. The first method is a linear programming (LP) construction algorithm which attempts to find a reflectivity function made of isolated delta functions. This method is computationally efficient and robust in the presence of noise. Importantly, it also lends itself to the incorporation of impedance constraints if such geologic information is available. A second construction method makes use of the fact that the Fourier transform of a reflectivity function for a layered earth can be modeled as an autoregressive (AR) process. The missing high and low frequencies can thus be predicted from the band‐limited reflectivity function by standard techniques. Stability in the presence of additive noise on the seismogram is achieved by predicting frequencies outside the known frequency band with operators of different orders and extracting a common signal from the results. Our construction algorithms are shown to operate successfully on a variety of synthetic examples. Two sections of field data are inverted, and in both the results from the LP and AR methods are similar and compare favorably to acoustic impedance features observed at nearby wells.",10.1190/1.1441413
Coherent Noise In Marine Seismic Data,"Despite significant advances in marine streamer design, seismic data are often plagued by coherent noise having approximately linear moveout across stacked sections. With an understanding of the characteristics that distinguish such noise from signal, we can decide which noise‐suppression techniques to use and at what stages to apply them in acquisition and processing. Three general mechanisms that might produce such noise patterns on stacked sections are examined: direct and trapped waves that propagate outward from the seismic source, cable motion caused by the tugging action of the boat and tail buoy, and scattered energy from irregularities in the water bottom and sub‐bottom. Depending upon the mechanism, entirely different noise patterns can be observed on shot profiles and common‐midpoint (CMP) gathers; these patterns can be diagnostic of the dominant mechanism in a given set of data. Field data from Canada and Alaska suggest that the dominant noise is from waves scattered within the shallow sub‐buttom. This type of noise, while not obvious on the shot records, is actually enhanced by CMP stacking. Moreover, this noise is not confined to marine data; it can be as strong as surface wave noise on stacked land seismic data as well. Of the many processing tools available, moveout filtering is best for suppressing the noise while preserving signal. Since the scattered noise does not exhibit a linear moveout pattern on CMP‐sorted gathers, moveout filtering must be applied either to traces within shot records and common‐receiver gathers or to stacked traces. Our data example demonstrates that although it is more costly, moveout filtering of the unstacked data is particularly effective because it conditions the data for the critical data‐dependent processing steps of predictive deconvolution and velocity analysis.",10.1190/1.1441516
Double-Weave 3D Seismic Acquisition — Part 2: Seismic Modeling And Subsurface Fold Analyses,"The compatibility of 3D double-weave acquisition designs with sparse Fourier reconstruction algorithms was examined using simple modeled seismic data. Zigzag and orthogonal double-weave acquisitions and random acquisition all had successful 5D sparse Fourier interpolation results. However, the simplicity and regularity of double-weave acquisition made it a more attractive alternative to random acquisition. The subsurface fold analysis of double-weave acquisition reveals nonuniform distribution of midpoint sampling in comparison with random and traditional orthogonal acquisition layouts. This can be alleviated by either using larger bin sizes or introducing random shifts to the shot-receiver lines of double-weave acquisition layouts. Zigzag double-weave acquisition reveals a more uniform offset-azimuth distribution compared with orthogonal double-weave, random, and traditional orthogonal acquisitions.",10.1190/geo2015-0162.1
3D Magnetization Inversion Using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering With Application To Geology Differentiation,Parts of the work were first presented at the 2014 SEG Annual Meeting and GEM Chengdu 2015.,10.1190/geo2015-0636.1
Numerical Modeling Of The Electromagnetic Response Of Three‐Dimensional Conductors In A Layered Earth,"This paper describes a numerical modeling program which was developed for computing the electromagnetic response of a three‐dimensional conductor in a layered earth. The algorithm is a hybrid one, in the sense that a finite‐element method is combined with an integral equation approach for the complete solution of the problem. In this approach, two relatively small matrices are inverted to obtain the secondary magnetic fields at the interior nodes of the subdivided volume. The finite‐element method requires special attention at low frequencies, i.e., when the body dimensions are small compared with the skin depth. The method was tested with various models involving spheres and rectangular dikes, and comparisons have been made with analytical, numerical, and scale‐modeling data. These comparisons generally show good agreement between our numerical model and the other models tested. Examples are given which show the flexibility and usefulness of this modeling algorithm when applied to a ground or airborne prospecting system with a coil separation of 10 m.",10.1190/1.1441941
Automatic Lineament Extraction From Potential-Field Images Using The Radon Transform And Gradient Calculation,"Linear anomalies are critical in the interpretation of gravity and magnetic data. Visual identification of lineaments is usually done by experienced interpreters, and identification results then have to undergo a digitization or import procedure. The traditional identification method has unavoidable subjectivity and inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we fuse the Radon transform (RT) with gradient calculation to process gravity or magnetic data and to realize automatic detection and extraction of lineaments. As part of the detection procedure, we define the RT-based mean gradient (MG), effective mean gradient (EMG), and residual mean gradient (RMG) in order to highlight long linear segments or to enhance short linear ones in the transform domain. The gradient forms are applied self-adaptively and self-selectively to gravity or magnetic images according to specific conditions. Gradient directions are also taken into account in the transformation procedure to emphasize the characteristics of linear anomalies. To extract the position and length of the detected lineaments from the transform domain, a constraint inverse searching method (CISM) is given and used to locate the starting and end points of the lineaments. The method can deal with the condition that there is at least one linear section in a specific direction or that separate linear sections may belong to one lineament. Through tests with synthetic images and with real data from the Haijiao upheaval area in the East China Sea Basin, the detection and extraction methods are shown to be more effective and robust than the conventional RT applications. The results from the real data roughly coincide with major geologic faults that are visually identified. These results show that the methods constitute a useful tool to aid fault interpretation.",10.1190/1.2194521
Source Separation For Simultaneous Towed-Streamer Marine Acquisition — A Compressed Sensing Approach,"Simultaneous marine acquisition is an economic way to sample seismic data and speed up acquisition, wherein single or multiple source vessels fire sources at near-simultaneous or slightly random times, resulting in overlapping shot records. The current paradigm for simultaneous towed-streamer marine acquisition incorporates ""low variability"" in source firing times, i.e., 0≤1 or 2 s because the sources and receivers are moving. This results in a low degree of randomness in simultaneous data, which is challenging to separate (into its constituent sources) using compressed-sensing-based separation techniques because randomization is key to successful recovery via compressed sensing. We have addressed the challenge of source separation for simultaneous towed-streamer acquisitions via two compressed-sensing-based approaches, i.e., sparsity promotion and rank minimization. We have evaluated the performance of the sparsity-promotion- and rank-minimization-based techniques by simulating two simultaneous towed-streamer acquisition scenarios, i.e., over/under and simultaneous long offset. A field data example from the Gulf of Suez for the over/under acquisition scenario was also developed. We observed that the proposed approaches gave good and comparable recovery qualities of the separated sources, but the rank-minimization technique outperformed the sparsity-promoting technique in terms of the computational time and memory. We also compared these two techniques with the normal-moveout-based median-filtering-type approach, which had comparable results.",10.1190/geo2015-0108.1
Leading-Order Seismic Imaging Using Curvelets,"Curvelets are plausible candidates for simultaneous compression of seismic data, their images, and the imaging operator itself. We show that with curvelets, the leading-order approximation (in angular frequency, horizontal wavenumber, and migrated location) to common-offset (CO) Kirchhoff depth migration becomes a simple transformation of coordinates of curvelets in the data, combined with amplitude scaling. This transformation is calculated using map migration, which employs the local slopes from the curvelet decomposition of the data. Because the data can be compressed using curvelets, the transformation needs to be calculated for relatively few curvelets only. Numerical examples for homogeneous media show that using the leading-order approximation only provides a good approximation to CO migration for moderate propagation times. As the traveltime increases and rays diverge beyond the spatial support of a curvelet; however, the leading-order approximation is no longer accurate enough. This shows the need for correction beyond leading order, even for homogeneous media.",10.1190/1.2785047
Edge Enhancement Of Potential-Field Data Using Normalized Statistics,"Edge enhancement in potential-field data helps geologic interpretation. There are many methods for enhancing edges, most of which are high-pass filters based on the horizontal or vertical derivatives of the field. Normalized standard deviation (NSTD), a new edge-detection filter, is based on ratios of the windowed standard deviation of derivatives of the field. NSTD is demonstrated using aeromagnetic data from Australia and gravity data from South Africa. Compared with other filters, the NSTD filter produces more detailed results.",10.1190/1.2837309

Information is listed on 759 velocity surveys, most of which were shot in the years 1955 and 1956. Corrections and additional information on 7 previously indexed surveys are tabulated.",10.1190/1.1438322
Footprint For Frequency-Domain Airborne Electromagnetic Systems,"An airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey often covers hundreds of square kilometers. Huge amounts of survey data make 2D/3D data inversion very difficult. However, due to the compact configurations of AEM systems, the sensitive area for each single survey station is much smaller than the whole survey area, which makes it possible to only invert partial survey data. The sensitive area is called the footprint. Based on ""moving-footprint"" technology, the entire survey can be divided into subareas and the data are first inverted individually and then combined to form the inversions of the entire survey area, so that the cost for forward and inverse modeling can be vastly reduced. Contrary to previous electromagnetic (EM) footprints defined only for an EM transmitter or for a perfectly conductive earth, we defined the frequency-domain AEM footprint by considering a complete AEM transmitter-receiver system over an earth with limited conductivity. We used the tensor Green's function to calculate the secondary magnetic field from the induced underground current and evaluate the EM footprint as the volume in which the induced current contributes 90% to the total secondary magnetic field at the EM receiver. Numerical experiments for horizontal coplanar and vertical coaxial coil configurations revealed that among all influence factors on the AEM footprint, the flight altitude was dominant, with a high flight altitude corresponding to a large EM footprint, whereas the transmitting frequency and earth resistivity played a secondary role and in a combined way of induction number, with the low frequency or high earth resistivity (small induction number) corresponding to large EM footprints.",10.1190/geo2014-0007.1
Sparse Code Shrinkage For Signal Enhancement Of Seismic Data,"Sparse code shrinkage is a method that is commonly used for image denoising and that has recently found some applications in seismic for random noise attenuation and multiple removal in a simplified form. Sparse coding finds a representation of the data in which each component is only rarely significantly active. Such a representation is closely related to independent component analysis. We discuss the link between sparse coding and independent component analysis, and show how the application of shrinkages to sparse components manages to attenuate the noise in seismic data. The use of data-driven shrinkages estimated from noise-free data is a necessary condition for this method to be efficient. We propose a realization of the data, attenuated in noise, that allows the derivation of data-driven shrinkage functions. They are obtained either by fitting this sparse representation with a given density model, or by estimating the density directly from the data. Two parametric models of density are investigated, the sparse density and the normal inverse Gaussian density, while the Gaussian kernel estimator estimates the density from the data. They are tested on both synthetic and real marine seismic data, and compared with f-x deconvolution and local SVD as alternative denoising methods. We show that the NIG density yields the best results, but the sparse density and the nonparametric density estimate are acceptable choices as well. Finally, the comparison with alternative methods shows that sparse code shrinkage is a credible alternative for the denoising of seismic data.",10.1190/geo2010-0128.1
Predicting Elasticity In Nonclastic Rocks With A Differential Effective Medium Model,"Can a theoretical inclusion model — specifically, the differential effective medium (DEM) model — match experimental velocity data in rocks that are not necessarily made of inclusions, such as clastics? It is indeed possible in some cases by using an almost constant inclusion aspect ratio (AR) within wide ranges of porosity and mineralogy. We approach this question by using empirical velocity-porosity equations as proxies for data. By finding a DEM inclusion AR to match these equations, we find that the required range of AR is narrow. Moreover, a constant AR of about 0.13 can be used to accurately match empirical relations in competent sand, shale, and quartz/calcite mixtures. This finding can be utilized practically to predict  VS  from  VP ; describe velocity-frequency dispersion between low-frequency and ultrasonic experiments; predict the dry-frame elastic properties from ultrasonic data on liquid-saturated samples where Gassmann's fluid substitution is not applicable; predict the attenuation of P-wave velocity; and establish tight constraints for ranges of possible variation of  VS  and  VP  at a given porosity in some mineralogies. When we apply this approach to laboratory data rather than empirical equations, we confirm a positive answer to the main question, with all applications of this result still valid.",10.1190/1.3267854
Depth Of Investigation In Electromagnetic Sounding Methods,"The time or frequency at which the electromagnetic (EM) response of a buried inhomogeneity can first be measured is determined by its depth of burial and the average conductivity of the overlying section; it is relatively independent of the type of source or receiver and their separation. The ability to make measurements at this time or frequency, however, depends on the sensitivity and accuracy of the instrumentation, the signal strength, and the ambient noise level. These factors affect different EM sounding systems in surprisingly different ways. For the magnetotelluric (MT) method, it is possible to detect a buried half‐space under about 1.5 skin depths of overburden. The maximum depth of investigation is virtually unbounded because of high signal strengths at low frequencies. Transient electromagnetic (TEM) soundings, on the other hand, have a limited depth of penetration, but are less affected by static shift errors. For TEM, a buried inhomogeneity can be detected under about one diffusion depth of overburden. For conventional near‐zone sounding in which induced voltage is measured (impulse response), the depth of investigation is proportional to the 15 power of the source moment and ground resistivity. By contrast, if the receiver is a magnetometer (step response system), the depth of investigation is proportional to the 13 power of source moment and is no longer a function of resistivity. Magnetic‐field measurements may, therefore, be superior for exploration in conductive areas such as sedimentary basins. Far‐zone, or long‐offset, TEM soundings are traditionally used for deep exploration. The depth of investigation for a voltage receiver is proportional to the 14 power of source moment and resistivity and is inversely proportional to the source‐receiver separation. Magnetic‐field measurements are difficult to make at long offsets because instrumental accuracy limits the measurement of the very slow decay of the magnetic field. Frequency‐domain controlled‐source systems are ideally suited for sounding at the very shallow depths needed for engineering, archaeological, and groundwater applications because of the relative ease of extending the measurements to arbitrarily high frequencies, and also because geometric soundings can be made at low induction numbers.",10.1190/1.1442716
Integrating Multiscale Parameters Information Into 3D Stochastic Magnetic Anomaly Inversion,"We present a 3D stochastic inversion method based on the geostatistical approach of cokriging for inversion of magnetic anomaly data on multiple scale parameters using borehole and surface data to limit the resulting solution space. Recovering susceptibilities in 3D magnetic anomaly inversion requires integration of many different data. These data mainly come from different sources with different volume supports (point and block support). The presented algorithm has the capability of inverting data on multiple supports using downscaling and upscaling. Borehole susceptibilities (point support) are up-scaled to block susceptibilities where some of them are selected as constraints. The block constraints are used in magnetic anomaly inversion and, finally, the inverted susceptibilities are down-scaled to small prisms. Two modes of application are presented: estimation and simulation. The method is first applied to a synthetic stochastic model. The results of downscaling and upscaling show the ability of the method to invert surface and borehole data simultaneously on multiple scale parameters. The results also clearly show the significant role of borehole data in improving depth resolution. Finally, a case study using susceptibility measurements collected on outcrops and on numerous borehole cores at the Perseverance mine (Quebec, Canada) is presented. The information from the recovered 3D model are useful in analyzing the geology of massive sulfide for the domain under study. It also shows that the addition of constraints at different scales helps in delineating bodies, which would have been missed by only using the magnetic anomaly data.",10.1190/geo2011-0287.1
Calibration Response Simulation Of A Triaxial Induction Tool With A Metal Mandrel,"The calibration of triaxial induction logging tools is commonly performed in large water tanks, which are costly and complicated to use. In contrast, calibration with a metal loop is relatively economical and convenient. A tilted metal loop is introduced to calibrate all the components of a triaxial induction tool simultaneously. We have evaluated and optimized parameters such as radius, resistance, azimuthal angle, and position of the calibration loop with the 3D finite-element method. For validation, the accuracy of the simulation method is verified with analytical solutions with consideration of the metal mandrel effect. A quantitative agreement is found between the simulation results and the measurements of a realistic triaxial induction tool with a metal mandrel. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the presence of the metal mandrel causes the nine components of the tool to change nonlinearly with the formation conductivities in the double logarithmic coordinate. This nonlinear effect can be reduced by eliminating the background signals from the metal mandrel. After the optimization of the parameters of the calibration loop, the responses of the triaxial induction tool can be calibrated accurately.",10.1190/geo2015-0012.1
Imaging Permeability Structure Within The Highly Permeable Carbonate Earth: Inverse Theory And Experiment,"In most oil reservoir rocks, the squirt flow characteristic frequency (fsq) range of 10–100 kHz is much less than the Biot characteristic frequency (f0) range of 1 MHz–1 GHz. In contrast, carbonate aquifers have very high permeability (10–3000 d) and the two characteristic frequencies are reversed: f0 from 10 Hz to 10 kHz and fsq from 1 MHz to 100 MHz. The principal objective of this paper is to develop a pilot inverse method for robust imaging of the high‐permeability structure within carbonate aquifers. An analytical approximate model called the super‐k model is developed. The super‐k model coincides numerically with the combined Biot and squirt‐flow mechanism model when permeability is higher than 100 md and the frequency is lower than 100 kHz (the super‐k regime). In the super‐k regime, the pore fluid is always relaxed so that the attenuation due to the Biot mechanism is roughly four times larger than that of the Biot model. Also, empirical equations are developed that relate the stiffness and rigidity of the skeletal frame and porosity of limestone to compression and shear wave velocities measured from ultrasonic data. The super‐k model is combined with the empirical elastic equations to derive a robust high permeability inverse model. Use of the super‐k inverse model is illustrated in an acoustic crosswell test section of a limestone aquifer between depths of 300 and 480 m over a horizontal width of 11 m. The acoustically imaged permeability, constructed from 4‐kHz velocity and attenuation tomograms, shows excellent agreement with the permeability data obtained hydraulically from pump tests and packer tests performed at four different depth intervals within the test section. The permeability image reveals that the high permeability channels run fairly randomly within the limestone aquifers.",10.1190/1.1598103

Present Status And Future Aspects Of Geophysical Exploration In Poland,"Geophysical methods of prospecting were introduced in Poland in 1923, or at about the same time as in the Gulf Coast. In the first stage local seismic refraction and electrical surveys were employed for private mining and oil companies. The Mintrop's refraction method has shown success in locating extension of salt deposits near Wieliczka and in Wapno. The Sundberg electromagnetic method was not entirely successful in mapping some lead and copper ore deposits. The same refers to the use of electromagnetic methods for mapping of oil structures. Steep anticlines and complicated structures in which oil mostly occurs within the area of the Carpathian Range were not favorable to be worked out with these methods which were not entirely developed and proved at that time.",10.1190/1.1439495
Double‐Track Profiling With The Gravity Meter,"This technique, providing, simultaneously, gravity values and horizontal gravity gradients, is briefly discussed because of its possible advantage in marine exploration using the underwater gravity meter. Operating these remote‐control meters at greater depth is rather cumbersome and costly if compared to surveys at the ground surface (Dobrin, 1960). However, a profile of average horizontal gradients, in addition to a regular gravity profile, would indicate positive or negative anomalies located away from the profile itself, and would help avoid gravity stations with insignificant interpretative value.",10.1190/1.1439699
Revealing Stratigraphy In Ground‐Penetrating Radar Data Using Domain Filtering,"A common‐offset ground‐penetrating radar profile was collected from a mid‐continent fluvial environment characterized by sand with discontinuous clay layers. Signal was separated from coherent noise by a domain filter that exploits local differences in dip between signal and noise. This filter proved effective in separating reflections from the direct air wave and from system ringing. The processed section locates the base of a Pleistocene river channel incised into bedrock and shows a change in a recent position of the river on the basis of radar character. The water table, which lies at a depth of approximately 2 m, is characterized by a continuous reflection. An earlier reflection is interpreted as a perched lens of water near the ground surface. The predominant frequency of both reflections varies greatly with position along the profile. Shallow cores taken along the profile provide evidence that grain size in the transition zone from saturated to unsaturated sediments may determine the predominant frequency of the associated radar reflection. The domain filter is also successful in separating transition zone reflections from saturated layer boundary reflections that are coincident in arrival time. It is possible, therefore, to determine both grain size in the transition zone and the dip of sediments immediately beneath it even if the reflections from the two are superimposed.",10.1190/1.1444548
Finite‐Element Computation Of Seismic Anomalies For Bodies Of Arbitrary Shape,"A method which uses observed frequency spectral ratios of seismic plane waves for exploration of ore bodies is now available. The new method is based on the numerical solution of the response of a two‐dimensional shallow structural anomaly to an upward‐moving seismic wave from a distant earthquake or explosion. Finite‐element analysis is used for both P- and S-waves. Solutions to the direct problem for bodies of arbitrary shape have not previously been available. Results in the time and frequency domains are discussed here for a salt ridge and for a massive sulfide body. For the inverse problem, interpretation using contours of spectral ratios along a surface profile is suggested.",10.1190/1.1440597
3-D Preserved Amplitude Prestack Depth Migration On A Workstation,We present an algorithm based on the ray+Born approximation for 3-D preserved amplitude prestack depth migration (PAPsDM) of seismic reflection data. This ray+Born inversion scheme allows the quantitative recovery of model perturbations. The Green's functions are estimated by dynamic ray tracing in 3-D heterogeneous smooth velocity fields with a wavefront construction (WFC) method. The PAPsDM algorithm was implemented on a single‐processor Sun Sparc 20 workstation. Special attention was paid to CPU efficiency and memory requirements. We present an application on a 3-D real marine data set (13 Gbytes). About one week of CPU time is needed to obtain a migrated image of 7 × 1 × 1 km.,10.1190/1.1444518
Elastic‐Wave Attenuation In Fluid‐Saturated Berea Sandstone,"In a previous publication (O'Hara, 1985), I presented detailed measurements on the attenuation of elastic waves in fluid‐saturated Berea sandstone. These measurements were used in a systematic empirical study of the frequency dependence of attenuation as a function of external pressure applied to the sandstone, pore fluid pressure, and the saturated sandstone temperature. Two pore fluids were used in the study: a brine solution and n-heptane. I measured the attenuation of the extensional and torsional rod modes of cylindrical specimens of the sandstone at identical conditions of pressure and temperature for each of the two fluids.",10.1190/1.1442707
Double Beamforming Processing In A Seismic Prospecting Context,"The use of larger numbers of sensors is becoming more common at the large, continental scale for deep-structure imaging in seismology, and at a smaller scale with exploration geophysics objectives. Seismic arrays require array processing from which new types of observables contribute to a better understanding of the wave propagation complexity. From among these array processing techniques, this study focuses on a way to select and identify different phases between two source-receiver arrays based on the double beamforming (DBF) method. At the exploration geophysics scale, the goal is to identify and separate low-amplitude body waves from high-amplitude dispersive surface waves. A synthetic data set from a finite-difference time-domain simulation is first used to validate the array processing method. From directional information obtained with DBF, and due to the double-plane wave projection, it is demonstrated that surface and body waves can be extracted with a higher efficacy compared to classical beamforming even at short offset. A seismic prospecting data set in a laterally heterogeneous medium is then investigated. This data set is a high-resolution survey which provides a perfect control on source and receiver arrays geometry. The separation between the direct surface and body waves is observed after DBF and ray bending is discussed from the additional azimuthal information.",10.1190/geo2012-0364.1
Viscosity Effects In Vibratory Mobilization Of Residual Oil,"The last decade has seen clarifications of the underlying capillary physics behind stimulation of oil production by seismic waves and vibrations. Computational studies have prevailed, however, and no viscous hydrodynamic theory of the phenomenon has been proposed. For a body of oil entrapped in a pore channel, viscosity effects are naturally incorporated through a model of two-phase core-annular flow. These effects are significant at the postmobilization stage, when the resistance of capillary forces is overcome and viscosity becomes the only force resisting an oil ganglion's motion. A viscous equation of motion follows, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) establishes the limits of its applicability. The theory allows inexpensive calculation of important geophysical parameters of reservoir stimulation for given pore geometries, such as the frequency and amplitude of vibrations needed to mobilize the residual oil. The theoretical mobilizing acceleration in seismic waves for a given frequency is accurate to within approximately 30% or better when checked against CFD. The advantages of the viscous theory over the inviscid one are twofold. The former can calculate complete time histories of forced displacement of an oil blob in a pore channel, including retardation by capillary forces, mobilization by vibrations, and an ensuing Haines jump. It also provides an approximately factor-of-two improvement in the calculation of the mobilizing acceleration needed to unplug a static ganglion.",10.1190/1.3429999
Simultaneous Inversion Of Prestack Seismic Data For Rock Properties Using Simulated Annealing,"A new prestack inversion algorithm has been developed to simultaneously estimate acoustic and shear impedances from P‐wave reflection seismic data. The algorithm uses a global optimization procedure in the form of simulated annealing. The goal of optimization is to find a global minimum of the objective function, which includes the misfit between synthetic and observed prestack seismic data. During the iterative inversion process, the acoustic and shear impedance models are randomly perturbed, and the synthetic seismic data are calculated and compared with the observed seismic data. To increase stability, constraints have been built into the inversion algorithm, using the low‐frequency impedance and background Vs/Vp models. The inversion method has been successfully applied to synthetic and field data examples to produce acoustic and shear impedances comparable to log data of similar bandwidth. The estimated acoustic and shear impedances can be combined to derive other elastic parameters, which may be used for identifying of lithology and fluid content of reservoirs.",10.1190/1.1527087
Fine‐Scale Correlation Between Temperature Gradient Logs And Lithology,"Two high‐precision continuous temperature gradient logs have been produced in a 600-m partially cased, water‐filled borehole for which a nearly complete core is available. The agreement between these gradient logs, obtained using a logging speed of 8 m/minute, is good; there is virtually no dc offset (less than 0.03°C/km), and the mean absolute error is approximately 0.5°C/km. A comparison of these profiles with detailed geologic logs of the core shows excellent precision and resolution. In situations where the thermal resistivity contrast is 50–100 percent, isolated strata as thin as 0.5 m are clearly indicated on the temperature gradient log. More subtle lithologic changes extending over larger depth intervals are also detectable. In several instances gradient contrasts on the order of 1°C/km extending over several meters have been clearly resolved. Comparison of the gradient logs with a thermal resistivity profile from laboratory measurements on the core material indicates that the steel well casing has no observable effect on the temperature gradient profile.",10.1190/1.1440801
Pore Fluids And Frequency‐Dependent Wave Propagation In Rocks,"Attenuation is the anelastic process which dissipates seismic energy by conversion to heat, thus decreasing the amplitude and modifying the frequency and phase content of a propagating wavelet. Laboratory measurements show seismic phase velocity and attenuation are dependent upon the fluid saturation and the product of frequency and pore‐fluid viscosity, with a peak in attenuation between the seismic and sonic bands. The dominant mechanism by which seismic energy is dissipated in the upper crust is local viscous fluid flow in pores of small aspect ratio. Phenomenologically, this behavior is modeled as a series of linear viscoelastic elements with a narrow distribution of relaxation times, where velocity and attenuation are related through the Hilbert transform. This model may be generalized to include constant-Q behavior, as observed in dry rocks. Solutions to the wave equation may be generated for an arbitrary frequency dependence of phase velocity and Q. When Q is nearly independent of frequency, the impulse response is asymmetric and the power spectrum is a straight line with slope proportional to Q. When Q is roughly proportional or inversely proportional to frequency, the impulse response is nearly symmetrical and the power spectrum is nonlinear. These results indicate that the frequency content, phase spectrum, and velocity may be strong indicators of the type of pore fluid in a formation. Alternatively, if the type of pore fluid is known, these attributes could be used to monitor temperature changes of a formation.",10.1190/1.1442050
"The Discovery History Of The University Oil Field, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana","The localized occurrence of salt water in shallow wells on and near the Louisiana State University campus, in addition to shells collected during the drilling of these wells, attracted the attention of geologists to this area prior to 1926. A torsion balance survey in 1931 was followed by a dry hole drilled in 1933 southeast of the present field. Three separate reflection seismograph surveys during the period of 1934 to 1937, on each one of which a well was drilled without establishing production, were made on the University structure prior to discovery in 1938. The location based on the first reflection seismograph survey should have resulted in the discovery of both the shallow and deep production, and the discovery location was finally made because of the oil and gas shows encountered in this abandoned test. After discovery, an additional reflection survey was made to detail the structure as an aid in development.",10.1190/1.1437406
"Targeting Nickel Sulfide Deposits From 3D Seismicreflection Data At Kambalda, Australia","The greenstone belts of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, host numerous Archaean gold, nickel, and iron ore deposits. These deposits typically are found in complex geologic structures hidden by a deep, heterogeneous, and often conductive regolith profile. This added complexity limits the depth of penetration for the potential field methods, but at the same time opens new revenue possibilities through the application of seismic methods. To explore this opportunity, we acquired high-resolution, experimental, 3D seismic data over Lake Lefroy in Kambalda, Western Australia. The main objective was to map exceptionally complex, deep structures associated with Kambalda dome. Survey design used 3D ray tracing to improve the distribution of the common reflection points across ultramafic-basalt contacts which host numerous small, high-grade nickel sulfide deposits. A combination of small explosive sources, high-shot/receiver density, and exceptionally good coupling over the ultrasalty lake surface produced seismic data of very high quality. Processing focused on computation of accurate static and dynamic corrections, whereas imaging was helped by the existing geologic model. Advanced volumetric interpretation supported by seismic forward modeling was used to guide mapping of the main lithological interfaces and structures. Forward modeling was carried out using rock properties obtained from ultrasonic measurements and one borehole, drilled in the proximity of the 3D seismic volume. Using this information, geometric constraints based on the typical size of ore bodies found in this mine and a simple window-based seismic attribute, several new targets were proposed. Three of these targets subsequently have been drilled and new zones of mineralization were intercepted. The case study presented demonstrates that high-quality, high-resolution, 3D seismic data combined with volumetric seismic interpretation could become a primary methodology for exploration of deep, small, massive sulfide deposits distributed across the Kambalda area.",10.1190/geo2011-0514.1
Separation Of Signal And Coherent Noise By Migration Filtering,"A key issue in wavefield separation is to find a domain where the signal and coherent noise are well separated from one another. A new wavefield separation algorithm, called migration filtering, separates data arrivals according to their path of propagation and their actual moveout characteristics. This is accomplished by using forward modeling operators to compute the signal and the coherent noise arrivals. A linearized least‐squares inversion scheme yields model estimates for both components; the predicted signal component is constructed by forward modeling the signal model estimate. Synthetic and field data examples demonstrate that migration filtering improves separation of P-wave reflections and surface waves, P-wave reflections and tube waves, P-wave diffractions, and S-wave diffractions. The main benefits of the migration filtering method compared to conventional filtering methods are better wavefield separation capability, the capability of mixing any two conventional transforms for wavefield separation under a general inversion framework, and the capability of mitigating the signal and coherent noise crosstalk by using regularization. The limitations of the method may include more than an order of magnitude increase in computation costs compared to conventional transforms and the difficulty of selecting the proper modeling operators for some wave modes.",10.1190/1.1444753
A Two‐Pass Approximation To 3-D Prestack Migration,"A two‐pass approximation to 3-D Kirchhoff migration simplifies the migration procedure by reducing it to a succession of 2-D operations. This approach has proven very successful in the zero‐offset case. A two‐pass approximation to 3-D migration is described here for the prestack case. Compared to the one‐pass approach, the scheme presented here provides significant reduction in computation time and a relatively simple data manipulation scheme. The two‐pass method was designed using velocity independent prestack time migration (DMO‐PSI) applied in the crossline direction, followed by conventional prestack depth migration in the inline direction. Velocity analysis, an important part of prestack migration, is also included in the two‐pass scheme. It is carried out as a 2-D procedure after 3-D effects are removed from the data volume. The procedure presented here is a practical full volume 3-D prestack migration. One of its main benefits is a realistic and efficient iterative velocity analysis procedure in three dimensions. The algorithm was designed in the frequency domain and the computational scheme was optimized by processing individual frequency slices independently. Irregular trace distribution, a feature that characterizes most 3-D seismic surveys, is implicitly accounted for within the two‐pass algorithm. A numerical example tests the performance of the two‐pass 3-D prestack migration program in the presence of a vertical velocity gradient. A 3-D land survey from a fold and thrust belt region was used to demonstrate the algorithm in a complex geological setting. The results were compared with images from other 2-D and 3-D migration schemes and show improved resolution and higher signal content.",10.1190/1.1443969
3-D Ray Modeling By Wavefront Construction In Open Models,"A synthesis of two newly developed concepts in 3-D modeling is developed in this paper: (1) The open, (noncomplete) seismic model, and (2) the ray tracing based wavefront (WF) construction method. The open model may contain interfaces with holes and other missing parts, which simplifies model building considerably because the input horizon data from standard interpretation and processing packages are often incomplete. A set of volumes is defined in the model. A volume is a logical unit that points to a set of property functions, e.g., P-velocity, S-velocity, and density. The properties are represented either as constants or as B-spline functions of the spatial coordinates (x, y) or (x, y, z). The volumes of the model are assigned to opposing sides of each interface and not to specific spatial areas of the model, which is the case in most (blocky) model representations. The interfaces are given explicitly by triangular grids where the sizes of the triangles are determined locally by the curvature of the interface. We show how modeling by WF construction is both possible and computationally efficient in open models, but only after some modifications to deal with the ambiguity of the model representation. It is not possible to find a unique volume for the spatial positions in an open model. Instead, the volumes (with associated velocities, etc.) are determined from the last interface encountered by each ray in the WF. To find an arrival in a receiver, the volume associated to the receiver has to match the volume of the WF hitting the receiver.",10.1190/1.1444697
Borehole Gravity Meter And Its Application,"The Shell Development borehole gravimeter is an instrument which utilizes as a measure of gravity the frequency of a chosen mode of vibration of a string supporting a freely suspended mass. The instrument, which is capable of determining differences in gravity between stations to one milligal or better, has been in semiroutine use by Shell for over two years. The most common application of such a meter, the determination of average densities for intervals of the order of one thousand feet, is illustrated by data from several wells.",10.1190/1.1439417
"Strategy For Automated Analysis Of Passive Microseismic Data Based On S-Transform, Otsu'S Thresholding, And Higher Order Statistics","Small-magnitude seismic events, either natural or induced microearthquakes, have increasingly been used in exploration seismology with applications ranging from hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoir exploration to high-resolution passive seismic tomography surveys. We developed an automated methodology for processing and analyzing continuously recorded, single-channel seismic data. This method comprised a chi-squared-based statistical test for microseismic event detection and denoising filtering in the S-transform domain based on the Otsu thresholding method. An automatic P-phase picker based on higher order statistics criteria was used. The method was used with data from a surface seismic station. The performance of the method was tested and evaluated on synthetic and real data from a microseismic network used in a high-resolution PST survey and revealed a high level of consistency.",10.1190/geo2011-0301.1
Regional‐Residual Gravity Anomaly Separation Using The Minimum‐Curvature Technique,One of the most difficult problems in gravity interpretation is the separation of regional and residual gravity anomalies from the Bouguer gravity anomaly. This study discusses the application of the minimum‐curvature method to determine the regional and residual gravity anomalies.,10.1190/1.1443041
The Influence Of Confining Pressure And Water Saturation On Dynamic Elastic Properties Of Some Permian Coals,"Laboratory measurements are described on Permian coals from Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia related to the dependence of ultrasonic P‐ and S‐wave velocities, attenuation, anisotropy and the dynamic elastic moduli on confining pressure, water saturation, and pore pressure. Five independent stiffness constants are used to represent the elastic anisotropy of the specimens as a function of confining pressure and water saturation. The anisotropy is believed to be controlled mainly by the internal structure of the coals, while the pressure dependence of the constants is controlled mainly by randomly oriented cracks. P‐ and S‐wave dispersions were measured on water‐saturated specimens as confining pressures increased from 2 MPa to 40 MPa. The samples represented cores taken both parallel and perpendicular to bedding planes. Velocities along bedding planes are marginally higher than those across bedding planes. This anisotropy is insensitive to confining pressure. Attenuation was also measured, both normal and parallel to bedding planes, on dry and water‐saturated specimens from 2 MPa to 40 MPa confining pressures. The experimental results show that dynamic elastic properties are potential indicators of the states of stress and saturation in coal seams, and provide necessary information for computer modeling and interpreting seismic surveys carried out to assist mine development.",10.1190/1.1443349
Borehole Damage Indicator From Stress-Induced Velocity Variations,"I develop a simple technique to indicate the onset of stress-induced mechanical damage near a wellbore. Stress concentrations near a wellbore can cause the yield strength of the rock to be exceeded. The resulting mechanical damage causes a decrease in acoustic velocity that precedes the development of breakouts. With laboratory experiments on stressed boreholes, I show that high-resolution, shallow acoustic measurements made inside the borehole can detect these stress-induced velocity changes. The onset of damage can be predicted by comparing these shallow measurements to a deep velocity measurement in undamaged rock. When the maximum shallow velocity is decreased by damage and approaches the deep velocity, I infer that damage has occurred and breakouts and/or borehole failure are imminent. If implemented in the oilfield, this technique could form the basis for a real-time damage warning for drillers that allows for preventive action.",10.1190/1.1852772
Quasi‐Static Transient Response Of A Conducting Permeable Two‐Layer Sphere In A Dipolar Field,"The paper presents a theoretical and numerical computation of the quasi‐static transient response of the multipoles induced in a two‐layer spherical model by a dipolar field. The sphere and its surrounding shell are of arbitrary conductivities and magnetic permeabilities. The shell, in general, acts as a screen. The early stages of the decay curves are influenced only by the physical and geometrical parameters of the shell. For inner spheres that are good conductors, the latter part of the decay curves are governed predominantly by the physical and geometrical parameters of the core.",10.1190/1.1440161
"Subsalt Imaging For Exploration, Production, And Development: A Review","The field of subsalt imaging has evolved rapidly in the last decade, thanks in part to the availability of low cost massive computing infrastructure, and also to the development of new seismic acquisition techniques that try to mitigate the problems caused by the presence of salt. This paper serves as an introduction to the special Geophysics section on Subsalt Imaging for EP. The purpose of the special section is to bring together practitioners of subsalt imaging in the wider sense, i.e., not only algorithm developers, but also the interpretation community that utilizes the latest technology to carry out subsalt exploration and development. The purpose of the paper is in many ways pedagogical and historical. We address the question of what subsalt imaging is and discuss the physics of the subsalt imaging problem, especially the illumination issue. After a discussion of the problem, we then give a review of the main algorithms that have been developed and implemented within the last decade, namely Kirchhoff and Beam imaging, one-way wavefield extrapolation methods and the full two-way reverse time migration. This review is not meant to be exhaustive, and is qualitative to make it accessible to a wide audience. For each method and algorithm we highlight the benefits and the weaknesses. We then address the imaging conditions that are a fundamental part of each imaging algorithm. While we dive into more technical detail, the section should still be accessible to a wide audience. Gathers of various sorts are introduced and their usage explained. Model building and velocity update strategies and tools are presented next. Finally, the last section shows a few results from specific algorithms. The latest techniques such as waveform inversion or the ""dirty salt"" techniques will not be covered, as they will be elaborated upon by other authors in the special section. With the massive effort that the industry has devoted to this field, much remains to be done to give interpreters the accurate detailed images of the subsurface that are needed. In that sense the salt is still winning, although the next decade will most likely change this situation.",10.1190/geo2011-0156.1
Algorithms For Removing Surface Water Signals From Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Infiltration Surveys,"Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (surface NMR) is a geophysical method that directly detects water and can be used to determine the depth profile of water content within the subsurface. Although surface NMR has proven useful for investigating groundwater in the saturated zone, its use to study the vadose zone is still in development. A recent study for the South Avra Valley Storage and Recovery Project (SAVSARP) demonstrated that surface NMR can be used to monitor infiltrating water associated with aquifer storage and recovery, a water resource management method in which surface water is stored in local aquifers during wet periods for use during dry periods. However, one of the major issues associated with using surface NMR to monitor infiltrating water is the influence of large bodies of surface water. We have examined the effect that large bodies of surface water have on the surface NMR signal, and we have developed three algorithms (the a priori, late-signal, and long-signal-inversion [LSI] algorithms) to remove this signal. Using synthetic data sets, we have assessed the efficacy of each algorithm and determined that, although each algorithm is capable of suppressing the signal from a water layer with a thickness ≤5  m, the LSI algorithm provides the most accurate and consistent results. Using a field example from the SAVSARP survey, we have evaluated the use of the LSI algorithm to suppress the surface water signal. Our results have indicated that the signal from surface water detected in a surface NMR survey can be suppressed to obtain the subsurface water content without the use of new measurement techniques or additional equipment.",10.1190/geo2015-0386.1
Shear‐Wave Splitting In Quaternary Sediments: Neotectonic Implications In The Central New Madrid Seismic Zone,"Determining the extent and location of surface/near‐surface structural deformation in the New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) is very important for evaluating earthquake hazards. A shallow shear‐wave splitting experiment, located near the crest of the Lake County uplift (LCU) in the central NMSZ, shows the presence of near‐surface azimuthal anisotropy believed to be associated with neotectonic deformation. A shallow four‐component data set, recorded using a hammer and mass source, displayed abundant shallow reflection energy on records made with orthogonal source‐receiver orientations, an indicator of shear‐wave splitting. Following rotation of the data matrix by 40°, the S1 and S2 sections (principal components of the data matrix) were aligned with the natural coordinate system at orientations of N35°W and N55°E, respectively. A dynamic mis‐tie of 8 ms at a two‐way traveltime of 375 ms produced an average azimuthal anisotropy of ≈2% between the target reflector (top of Quaternary gravel at a depth of 35 m) and the surface. Based on the shear‐wave polarization data, two explanations for the azimuthal anisotropy in the study area are (1) fractures/cracks aligned in response to near‐surface tensional stress produced by uplift of the LCU, and (2) faults/fractures oriented parallel to the Kentucky Bend scarp, a recently identified surface deformation feature believed to be associated with contemporary seismicity in the central NMSZ. In addition to increased seismic resolution by the use of shear‐wave methods in unconsolidated, water‐saturated sediments, measurement of near‐surface directional polarizations, produced by shear‐wave splitting, may provide valuable information for identifying neotectonic deformation and evaluating associated earthquake hazards.",10.1190/1.1444102
3D Ps-Wave Imaging With Elastic Reverse-Time Migration,"One of the important features of elastic reverse-time migration is that it is a depth domain prestack migration method based on a vectorial wavefield. PP- and PS-wave images can be easily generated by implementing an imaging condition to pure wave modes separated with divergence and curl operators in isotropic media. In the 3D case, however, the curl calculation will generate a 3C vector S-wave, which makes it impossible to generate a scalar PS image with the crosscorrelation imaging condition. Therefore, we first analyzed the polarity distribution of a 3D S-wave and concluded that the separated S-wave keeps perpendicular to a plane determined by the particle motion direction and the propagation direction of the S-wave. This specific plane is the raypath plane when the S-wave is excited by an incident P-wave. The normal direction of the raypath plane can be calculated by computing the vector product of the propagation directions of source and receiver wavefields. Then, we used this normal direction as the reference direction of the S-wave to scalarize the S-wave. Scalarization can be achieved by assigning a positive sign if the vector S-wave is equidirectional with the reference direction or a negative sign if the vector S-wave is contradirectional with the reference direction. Additionally, the scalar S-wave has the same absolute value as the vector S-wave. Next, the P-wave and the scalar S-wave can be applied to an imaging condition to generate a scalar PS image. Numerical examples with true velocity models and those in the presence of velocity error and data noise are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.",10.1190/geo2013-0253.1
Electrical-Prospecting Method For Hydrocarbon Search Using The Induced-Polarization Effect,"We propose a method of surface and marine electrical prospecting using controlled-source excitation. The method is designed to detect hydrocarbon deposits at depths of a few kilometers and to map their boundaries. The technique is based on imaging the induced-polarization (IP) parameters of the geologic formation. We use the fact that, because of the imaginary part of the electric conductivity, polarized media support wave propagation processes whose nature is similar to displacement currents induced by the dielectric permittivity. However, unlike displacement currents, these processes reveal themselves at much lower frequencies and, therefore, at greater depths. It is established that the ratio of the second and the first differences of the electric potential does not decay after the current turn-off in polarized media, whereas it decays quickly if the IP effect is absent. Thus, the IP response can be observed directly and separated from the electromagnetic (EM) response. We use a vertical focusing of the electric current to decrease the effect of laterally adjacent formations to apply a 1D layered model in a 3D environment. This method obtained promising results in several regions of Russia.",10.1190/1.2217367
"The Fallacy Of The ""Shallow-Water Problem"" In Marine Csem Exploration","The recent explosion of activity in offshore controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) exploration has shown, both theoretically and in practice for the time-harmonic case, that shallow-water environments (depths less than, say,   300 m  ) can pose a significant challenge for detection and characterization of thin resistive targets in the subsurface because the weakly attenuated atmospheric response overprints the weaker target response. As an alternative, the transient CSEM experiment is considered to explore the nature of the ""airwave"" signature when viewed from the perspective of CSEM time series. The signature of a thin, isolated, resistive horizon is computed by using the quasi-analytic solution for a 1D earth in response to excitation by a horizontal electric dipole antenna. That signature, clearly seen in the transient data, generally lies in the time interval between the arrivalof the airwave and the late-time seawater response.The fact that either decreasing the water depth or increasing the source-receiver offset broadens this time interval suggests a target response that is generally easier to identify in shallow water than when viewed from a frequency-domain perspective. The airwave arrival is nearly synchronous across an inline receiver array, whereas the response time of the conducting elements of the model — the sea, the sediments, and the target — increases with increasing source-receiver offset. At short offsets (less than a few kilometers), and in intermediate water depths (approximately   500 m  ), these signatures can overlap and be difficult to decouple. However, modeling results also show that moveout rates of the post-airwave arrival may be used to infer the presence and depth of thin resistive targets within the geologic section to depths of   2 km   below   100 m   of water.",10.1190/1.2786868
Numerical Study Of The Interface Errors Of Finite-Difference Simulations Of Seismic Waves,"Numerical simulations of wave propagation produce different errors and the most well known is numerical dispersion, which is only valid for homogeneous media. However, there is a lack of error studies for heterogeneous media or even for the canonical case of media that have two constant velocity layers. The error associated with media that have two layers is called an interface error, and it typically converges to zero with a lower order of convergence compared to the theoretical convergence rate of the finite-difference schemes (FDS) for homogeneous media. We evaluated a detailed numerical study of the interface error for three staggered-grid FDS that are commonly used in the simulation of seismic-wave propagation. We determined that a standard staggered-grid scheme (SSGS) (also known as the Virieux scheme), a rotated staggered-grid scheme (RSGS), and a Lebedev scheme (LS) preserve the second order of convergence at horizontal/vertical solid-solid interfaces when the medium parameters have been properly modified, such as by harmonic averaging of finely layered media for the stiffness tensor and arithmetic mean for the density. However, for a fluid-solid interface aligned with the grid line, a second-order convergence can only be achieved by an SSGS. In addition, the presence of a fluid-solid interface reduces the order of convergence for the LS and the RSGS to a first order of convergence. The presence of inclined interfaces makes high-order (second and more) convergence impossible.",10.1190/geo2013-0299.1
The Inverse Problem Of Magnetotelluric Sounding,"Based on the model of a flat layered earth, a nonlinear, least‐squares method is used to invert magnetotelluric sounding curves to obtain the layer resistivities and thicknesses. Partial derivatives of the apparent resistivity with respect to layer parameters show the manner in which the layer parameters are contrbuting to the apparent resistivities. Uniqueness of the inversion is not guaranteed, but when the partial derivatives are linearly independent and the relative magnitudes of the layer resistivities of the initial guess are not too far from the correct ones, the convergence of the method to the correct values seems to be ensured.",10.1190/1.1439991
Angle‐Dependent Reflectivity By Means Of Prestack Migration,"Most present day seismic migration schemes determine only the zero‐offset reflection coefficient for each grid point (depth point) in the subsurface. In matrix notation, the zero‐offset reflection coefficient is found on the diagonal of a reflectivity matrix operator that transforms the illuminating source‐wave field into a reflected‐wave field. However, angle dependent reflectivity information is contained in the full reflectivity matrix. Our objective is to obtain angle‐dependent reflection coefficients from seismic data by means of prestack migration (multisource, multioffset). After downward extrapolation of source and reflected wave fields to one depth level, the rows of the reflectivity matrix (representing angle‐dependent reflectivity information for each grid point at that depth level) are recovered by deconvolving the reflected wave fields  with the related source wave fields. This process is carried out in the space‐frequency domain. In order to preserve the angle‐dependent reflectivity in the imaging we must not only add all frequency contributions but we should extend the imaging principle by adding along lines of constant angle in the wavenumber‐frequency domain. This procedure is carried out for each grid point. The resulting amplitude information provides a rigorous approach to amplitude‐versus‐offset related methods. The new imaging technique has been tested on media with horizontal layers. However, with our shot‐record oriented algorithm it is possible to handle any subsurface geometry. The first tests show excellent results up to high angles, both in the acoustic and in the elastic case. With angle‐dependent reflectivity information it becomes feasible to derive detailed velocity and density information in a subsequent stratigraphic inversion step.",10.1190/1.1442938
Reflections From Multiple Transition Layers Part Ii—Experimental Investigation,It has been shown that the velocity of longitudinal waves in a nylon rod is a linear function of the temperature for the range 20°C. to 100°C. Use is made of this property to study reflections from multiple transition layers.,10.1190/1.1438463
Grain Shape Effects On Dielectric And Electrical Properties Of Rocks,"Recently there has been a considerable interest in the effect of anisotropy in the grain shape in the electrical and dielectrical properties of rocks and other inhomogeneous media (Sen 1981a, b; Sen et al, 1981; Mendelson and Cohen, 1982; and Kenyon, 1983). In this note I point out that equation (34) of Mendelson and Cohen (MC) is incorrect. The dc limit of MC equation (34) for the conductivity of rock σ, in terms of porosity ϕ and water conductivity σw, gives ",10.1190/1.1441695
A Rectangular Loop Source Of Current On Multilayered Earth,"The idea of using electromagnetic (EM) fields to delineate layered‐earth structure is not new. In fact, the theory of EM depth sounding is very well developed mainly because all EM problems in stratified media in which stratification is horizontal are amenable to elegant mathematical solutions. A recent book on EM sounding by Patra and Mallick (1980) lists important earlier publications on the subject. With the addition of Wait (1962) and Ward (1967), this is a fairly comprehensive list and is recommended for interested readers.",10.1190/1.1441398
Reduced‐Time Migration Of Transmitted Ps Waves,"We also present a new interferometric method, denoted as reduced‐time migration, which uses the arrival‐time difference between the direct P‐wave and subsequent events to increase migration accuracy. Reduced‐time migration removes static time shifts in the data, decreases the focusing error due to an incorrect migration velocity model, and relocates reflection or PS transmission events to be closer to their true positions. Although limited to crosswell and VSP geometries, synthetic‐ and field‐data examples show that reduced‐time migration is noticeably more accurate than conventional migration in the presence of static shifts and/or migration velocity errors. The main assumption of reduced‐time migration is that the direct wave samples errors which are representative of errors in the migration aperture. Transmission wavepaths, in general, are subparallel to the direct wave and therefore the two modes encounter similar errors and, hence, reduced‐time migration is effective in improving the focusing of migration energy. For the PP reflection case, the direct wave and the reflected waves often traverse different parts of the earth, therefore, reduced‐time migration will remove static shifts but it is not expected to mitigate velocity errors if the errors are spatially variant. However, if there is a general and consistent bias in the velocity model, reduced‐time migration is expected to deliver improved results over conventional Kirchhoff migration.",10.1190/1.1620643
Finite‐Difference Modeling Of Viscoelastic Materials With Quality Factors Of Arbitrary Magnitude,For frequency‐dependent quality factors we present a modified numerical scheme to compute a nearly optimal rational approximation of the viscoelastic modulus.,10.1190/1.1759468
Seismic Signal Band Estimation By Interpretation Of F-X Spectra,"The signal band of reflection seismic data is that portion of the temporal Fourier spectrum which is dominated by reflected source energy. The signal bandwidth directly determines the spatial and temporal resolving power and is a useful measure of the value of such data. The realized signal band, which is the signal band of seismic data as optimized in processing, may be estimated by the interpretation of appropriately constructed f-x spectra. A temporal window, whose length has a specified random fluctuation from trace to trace, is applied to an ensemble of seismic traces, and the temporal Fourier transform is computed. The resultant f-x spectra are then separated into amplitude and phase sections, viewed as conventional seismic displays, and interpreted. The signal is manifested through the lateral continuity of spectral events; noise causes lateral incoherence. The fundamental assumption is that signal is correlated from trace to trace while noise is not. A variety of synthetic data examples illustrate that reasonable results are obtained even when the signal decays with time (i.e., is nonstationary) or geologic structure is extreme. Analysis of real data from a 3-C survey shows an easily discernible signal band for both P-P and P-S reflections, with the former being roughly twice the latter. The potential signal band, which may be regarded as the maximum possible signal band, is independent of processing techniques. An estimator for this limiting case is the corner frequency (the frequency at which a decaying signal drops below background noise levels) as measured on ensemble‐averaged amplitude spectra from raw seismic data. A comparison of potential signal band with realized signal band for the 3-C data shows good agreement for P-P data, which suggests the processing is nearly optimal. For P-S data, the realized signal band is about half of the estimated potential. This may indicate a relative immaturity of P-S processing algorithms or it may be due to P-P energy on the raw radial component records.",10.1190/1.1444522
"Depth-Time Correction Of Petroleum Bottom-Hole Temperatures In The Po Plain, Italy","We have analyzed a wide set of time-temperature data from petroleum wells in two areas of the Po Plain, Italy, and propose empirical temperature corrections for mud circulation. Formation thermal parameters and the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity are taken into account. Analyses show that formation equilibrium temperatures computed with the Horner method compare well with those obtained by the Cooper and Jones method, which gives, on average, temperatures lower by only   2 °C   for shut-in times less than   10 hours  . The corrected temperatures compared with temperatures measured during drillstem tests show that the proposed corrections are relatively accurate. The two data sets give coherent results, and the inferred average geothermal gradient is   21.5 mK∕m   in the Apenninic buried arc area and   25.2 mK∕m   in the South Piedmont Basin–Pedealpine homocline area. The Horner slope data as a function of depth are then fitted with a second-order polynomial, and depth-time-correction equations are calibrated for the two areas. Finally, we propose an empirical function for the estimate of the mud-circulation time, which is often unavailable.",10.1190/1.2976629
Avo Inversion Of Troll Field Data,"A stratigraphic elastic inversion scheme has been applied to a data set from the Troll East Field, offshore Norway. The objective of the present work is to obtain estimates of the P‐ and S‐wave velocities and densities of the subsurface. The inversion is carried out on τ − p transformed common depth‐point (CMP) gathers. The forward modeling is performed by convolving a wavelet with the reflectivity that includes water‐bottom multiples, transmission effects, and absorption and array effects. A damped Gauss‐Newton algorithm is used to minimize a least‐squares misfit function. Inversion results show good correlation between the estimated VP/VS ratios and the lithologies in the wells. The VP/VS ratio is estimated to 2.1–3.0 for shale and 1.6–2.0 for sandstones. In the reservoir, the VP/VS ratio is estimated to 1.55 in the gas sand and to 1.62 below the fluid contact.",10.1190/1.1444078
Marine Resistivity Tomography For Coastal Engineering Applications In Greece,"The marine resistivity tomography method can be useful for coastal engineering applications through the use of immersion cables, laid on the water bottom, thus achieving a deeper and more detailed detection of the formations underneath. Careful positioning of the profiles related to the available geologic, geomorphological, bathymetric, and drilling data and to the requirements of engineers, can give thicknesses of loose material as well as the bedrock relief. The formations and their interfaces are clearly defined either by calibration with available drilling data or by high resistivity changes which indicate discontinuities with resistivity values related to permeability and saline water presence. Two case studies are under examination. The first concerns the preservation of an old iron bridge in Lavrion Port with reinforcement and new foundations. Here, the geophysical investigation detects the formation on which the bridge was founded, as well as the loose material above it. The second case study concerns geophysical investigation asked by a construction company for the marine excavation work needed in the new Mesta port. Here, the geophysical measurements with the detected formations give valuable information with respect to the volume of material, equipment, time and cost of excavation as well as where the foundations will be laid for new constructions.",10.1190/geo2011-0349.1
Tesseroids: Forward-Modeling Gravitational Fields In Spherical Coordinates,"We have developed the open-source software Tesseroids, a set of command-line programs to perform forward modeling of gravitational fields in spherical coordinates. The software is implemented in the C programming language and uses tesseroids (spherical prisms) for the discretization of the subsurface mass distribution. The gravitational fields of tesseroids are calculated numerically using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature (GLQ). We have improved upon an adaptive discretization algorithm to guarantee the accuracy of the GLQ integration. Our implementation of adaptive discretization uses a ""stack-based"" algorithm instead of recursion to achieve more control over execution errors and corner cases. The algorithm is controlled by a scalar value called the distance-size ratio (D) that determines the accuracy of the integration as well as the computation time. We have determined optimal values of D for the gravitational potential, gravitational acceleration, and gravity gradient tensor by comparing the computed tesseroids effects with those of a homogenous spherical shell. The values required for a maximum relative error of 0.1% of the shell effects are D=1 for the gravitational potential, D=1.5 for the gravitational acceleration, and D=8 for the gravity gradients. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results show that the potential and its first and second derivatives require different values of D to achieve the same accuracy. These values were incorporated as defaults in the software.",10.1190/geo2015-0204.1
Sea Magnetometer Reconnaissance Of Hudson Bay,"A total of 6,500 nautical miles of sea magnetometer data were obtained during the 1961 cruise of the M. V. THETA in Hudson Bay. Near the edge of the Bay the resultant magnetic profiles are made up of short‐wavelength, high‐amplitude anomalies whereas the anomalies in the center of the Bay are of longer wavelength and of lower amplitude. This is a reflection of the depth to the crystalline basement. This observation is confirmed by a quantitative interpretation of the magnetic profiles, which shows that, in general, the depths to basement are least around the margins of the Bay, with the greatest calculated depths, in excess of 10,000 feet, occurring in the area to the northeast of Churchill. The depth‐determination values also reveal that an asymmetrical troughlike basement feature occurs in the area between Southampton, Nottingham, Mansel, Coats, and Digges Islands.",10.1190/1.1439441
"The 4D Microgravity Method For Waterflood Surveillance: Part Ii — Gravity Measurements For The Prudhoe Bay Reservoir, Alaska","Between 1994 and 2002, a series of experiments was conducted at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, aimed at the development of an effective 4D (or time-lapse) gravity technique. Theoretical investigations had pointed out the potential for monitoring water injection in the   2500-m  -deep reservoir, but it was not clear that gravity measurements of sufficient accuracy could be made in the arctic environment. During the course of these experiments, new techniques and instrumentation were introduced and perfected for both gravity and position measurements. Gravity stations are located using high-precision global positioning system (GPS) techniques without permanent monuments. Robust methods for meter drift control have improved noise resistance in relative gravimeter surveys. Absolute gravity measurements with a field-portable instrument maintain absolute gravity levels among surveys. A 4D gravity-difference noise of   12 μGal   standard deviation has been established at Prudhoe Bay for GPS-controlled relative gravimeter surveys. The lessons learned are now being applied to full-scale waterflood monitoring at Prudhoe Bay. The basic technique is applicable to microgravity surveys and 4D microgravity surveys for any purpose.",10.1190/1.2435473
Instantaneous Phase Variation For Seismic Velocity Monitoring From Ambient Noise At The Exploration Scale,"Recent studies in geophysics have investigated the use of seismic-noise correlations to measure weak-velocity variations from seismic-noise recordings. However, classically, the existing algorithms used to monitor medium velocities need extensive efforts in terms of computation time. This implies that these techniques are not appropriate at smaller scales in an exploration context when continuous data sets on dense arrays of sensors have to be analyzed. We applied a faster technique that allows the monitoring of small velocity changes from the instantaneous phase measurement of the seismic-noise crosscorrelation functions. We performed comparisons with existing algorithms using synthetic signals. The results we have obtained for a real data set show that the statistical distribution of the velocity-change estimates provides reliable measurements, despite the low signal-to-noise ratio obtained from the noise-correlation process.",10.1190/geo2011-0363.1
Some Aspects Of Multiple Recording In Seismic Prospecting,"Considerable attention has been given to the use of more than one geophone on each recording channel with the hope of increasing the signal‐to‐noise ratio, where ""signal"" is taken to mean ""recorded reflection"" and ""noise"" means any undesired recorded amplitude. The average expectancy of this gain is evaluated analytically, and the statistical distribution examined. Since at different instants this gain possesses different values dependent on a large number of causes, these causes are assumed to be random in nature; a justification of this and other assumptions is explained, and the distribution of gain in terms of frequency of occurrence is expressed in the form of a probability curve. From this analysis an answer can be inferred to the question, ""if n is the number of geophones, what is the probability that a gain of k⋅n will occur?"".",10.1190/1.1437129
Em Response Of An Arbitrary Source On A Layered Earth: A New Computational Approach,"The electromagnetic response of a layered earth is expressed in rectangular coordinates and the solution is obtained as a double inverse Fourier transform. This simplilfies the theoretical development for any EM source, grounded or not, and the fast Fourier transform algorithm may be used to evaluate the fields. In some cases where complicated source geometries are used and where the fields are required over a large area or volume, the procedure may lead to a substantial reduction in computation costs. The standard problems of the numerical fast Fourier transform algorithm may be overcome by using correction techniques such as pre‐aliasing. An analysis of the ground‐wire EM source shows that the infinite line is a poor approximation to the long grounded line due to the strong component of galvanic current in the ground.",10.1190/1.1440567
Borehole Logging For Uranium By Gamma‐Ray Spectrometry,"The resources in a large syngenetic deposit of low‐grade uranium (U) ore with thorium at Kvanefjeld, South Greenland, were evaluated by spectrometric gamma‐ray logging of 23 boreholes, 46 mm in diameter and 200 m deep. The borehole probe's detector contained 22cm3 of sodium‐iodide, and the photomultiplier gain was stabilized electronically using barium‐133 (133Ba) reference gamma rays. The downhole measurements were carried out at depth intervals of 25 cm, and for each stationary position of the borehole probe, counts were accumulated for 100 sec in four energy windows. The calibration constants of the spectrometer system were determined by calculating the average number of U and thorium (Th) counts per meter of borehole and comparing these with the U‐Th concentrations in 1‐m sections of analyzed drill core. The sensitivity and the background count rate in the uranium window varied appreciably from one hole to another; this variation is believed to be caused by emanation of radon (Rn) from the borehole walls. Block calculations based on individual calibration constants for the boreholes logged made it possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the tonnage of U. This estimate was only slightly different from the tonnage evaluated from a large number of core assays.",10.1190/1.1441108
Mapping Multiple Attributes To Three- And Four-Component Color Models — A Tutorial,"During the past 30 years, seismic attributes have evolved beyond simple measures of amplitude, frequency, and phase to include measures of waveform similarity, amplitude variation with offset (AVO), spectral content, and structural deformation. Although neural networks and geostatistics are effective ways of combining the information content of these many attributes, such analyses cannot replicate the pattern-recognition capabilities of an experienced interpreter. For this reason, careful visualization and display of multiple attributes remains one of the most powerful interpretation tools at our disposal. The two most important color display models are based on red, green, and blue (RGB) or hue, lightness, and saturation (HLS). Each of these color models in turn can be modulated by transparency. We recommend using the RGB color model to map attributes of similar type, such as-volumes of near-, mid-, and far-angle amplitude or low-, moder-ate-, and high-frequency spectral components. The HLS model is preferred when one attribute modulates another, such as dip magnitude modulating dip azimuth or amplitude of the peak spectral frequency modulating the phase measured at the peak frequency. Transparency/opacity provides a fourth color dimension and additional attribute modulation capabilities. This tutorial demonstrates those attributes best displayed in each of the two basic color models with examples from the Gulf of Mexico and Fort Worth Basin, Texas, U.S.A. Sometimes these combinations can be achieved using commercial voxel-based interpretation software. By careful use of color and transparency applied to modern volumetric attributes, one can display the strike of faults and flexures in three dimensions, isolate collapse features, and qualitatively display the geomorphology and thickness of channels.",10.1190/1.2903819
Massively Parallel Structured Direct Solver For Equations Describing Time-Harmonic Qp-Polarized Waves In Tti Media,We considered the discretization and approximate solutions of equations describing time-harmonic qP-polarized waves in 3D inhomogeneous anisotropic media. The anisotropy comprises general (tilted) transversely isotropic symmetries. We are concerned with solving these equations for a large number of different sources. We considered higher-order partial differential equations and variable-order finite-difference schemes to accommodate anisotropy on the one hand and allow higher-order accuracy — to control sampling rates for relatively high frequencies — on the other hand. We made use of a nested dissection based domain decomposition in a massively parallel multifrontal solver combined with hierarchically semiseparable matrix compression techniques. The higher-order partial differential operators and the variable-order finite-difference schemes require the introduction of separators with variable thickness in the nested dissection; the development of these and their integration with the multifrontal solver is the main focus of our study. The algorithm that we developed is a powerful tool for anisotropic full-waveform inversion.,10.1190/geo2011-0163.1
3D Finite-Difference Frequency-Domain Modeling Of Visco-Acoustic Wave Propagation Using A Massively Parallel Direct Solver: A Feasibility Study,"We present a finite-difference frequency-domain method for 3D visco-acoustic wave propagation modeling. In the frequency domain, the underlying numerical problem is the resolution of a large sparse system of linear equations whose right-hand side term is the source. This system is solved with a massively parallel direct solver. We first present an optimal 3D finite-difference stencil for frequency-domain modeling. The method is based on a parsimonious staggered-grid method. Differential operators are discretized with second-order accurate staggered-grid stencils on different rotated coordinate systems to mitigate numerical anisotropy. An antilumped mass strategy is implemented to minimize numerical dispersion. The stencil incorporates 27 grid points and spans two grid intervals. Dispersion analysis showsthat four grid points per wavelength provide accurate simulations in the 3D domain. To assess the feasibility of the method for frequency-domain full-waveform inversion, we computed simulations in the 3D SEG/EAGE overthrust model for frequencies 5, 7, and   10 Hz  . Results confirm the huge memory requirement of the factorization (several hundred Figabytes) but also the CPU efficiency of the resolution phase (few seconds per shot). Heuristic scalability analysis suggests that the memory complexity of the factorization is   O (35 N4 )    for a  N3  grid. Our method may provide a suitable tool to perform frequency-domain full-waveform inversion using a large distributed-memory platform. Further investigation is still necessary to assess more quantitatively the respective merits and drawbacks of time- and frequency-domain modeling of wave propagation to perform 3D full-waveform inversion.",10.1190/1.2759835
An Analysis Leading To The Reduction Of Scattered Noise On Deep Marine Seismic Records,"The rough and uneven basaltic basement in deep marine environments functions as a potential source of scattering. The source‐generated noise not only interferes with the weak and deep primary reflections, but often resembles primary reflections, thereby confusing the seismic interpretation. An analysis of the arrival time of scattered noise indicates that NMO and apparent dip of scattered noise exhibit azimuth dependence. For isotropic scattering, in‐line scattering at ranges near 0 degree azimuth and sideswipe from 90 degree azimuth should dominate the seismic section. Actual marine data displayed in various data gathers illustrate these characteristics of scattered noise and also correct a common misconception about the appearance of scattered noise. The analysis suggests the use of CDP stacking and velocity filtering to attenuate the scattered noise. The combined effect shows a total reduction of scattered noise by 21 dB for the frequency bandwidth from 20 to 32 Hz.",10.1190/1.1441556
Inversion Of 3D Electromagnetic Data In Frequency And Time Domain Using An Inexact All‐At‐Once Approach,"We present a general formulation for inverting frequency‐ or time‐domain electromagnetic data using an all‐at‐once approach. In this methodology, the forward modeling equations are incorporated as constraints and, thus, we need to solve a constrained optimization problem where the parameters are the electromagnetic fields, the conductivity model, and a set of Lagrange multipliers. This leads to a much larger problem than the traditional unconstrained formulation where only the conductivities are sought. Nevertheless, experience shows that the constrained problem can be solved faster than the unconstrained one. The primary reasons are that the forward problem does not have to be solved exactly until the very end of the optimization process, and that permitting the fields to be away from their constrained values in the initial stages introduces flexibility so that a stationary point of the objective function is found more quickly. In this paper, we outline the all‐at‐once approach and apply it to electromagnetic problems in both frequency and time domains. This is facilitated by a unified representation for forward modeling for these two types of data. The optimization problem is solved by finding a stationary point of the Lagrangian. Numerically, this leads to a nonlinear system that is solved iteratively using a Gauss‐Newton strategy. At each iteration, a large, indefinite matrix is inverted, and we discuss how this can be accomplished. As a test, we invert frequency‐domain synthetic data from a grounded electrode system that emulates a field CSAMT survey. For the time domain, we invert borehole data obtained from a current loop on thesurface.",10.1190/1.1801938
Investigating The Stratigraphy Of An Alluvial Aquifer Using Crosswell Seismic Traveltime Tomography,"In this study, we investigate the use of crosswell P-wave seismic tomography to obtain spatially extensive information about subsurface sedimentary architecture and heterogeneity in alluvial aquifers. Our field site was a research wellfield in an unconfined aquifer near Boise, Idaho. The aquifer consists of a ∼ 20-m-thick sequence of alluvial cobble-and-sand deposits, which have been subdivided into five stratigraphic units based on neutron porosity logs, grain-size analysis, and radar reflection data. We collected crosswell and borehole-to-surface seismic data in wells   17.1 m   apart. We carefully considered the impact of well deviation, data quality control, and the choice of inversion parameters. Our linearized inverse routine had a curved-ray forward model and used different grids for forward modeling and inversion. An analysis of the model covariance and resolution matrices showed that the velocity models had an uncertainty of   10 m∕s  , a vertical resolution of   ∼ 1 m  , and a horizontal resolution of   ∼ 5 m  . The velocity in the saturated zone varied between   2100 m∕s   and   2700 m∕s  . Inclusion of the borehole-to-surface data eliminated the X- shaped pattern that is a common artifact in crosswell tomography, and the increased angular coverage also improved the accuracy of the model near the top of the tomogram. The final velocity model is consistent with previous stratigraphic analyses of the site, although the locations of some of the unit boundaries differ by as much as   2 m   in places. The results of this study demonstrate that seismic tomography can be used to image the sedimentary architecture of unconsolidated alluvial aquifers, even when the lithologic contrasts between units are subtle.",10.1190/1.2195487
Some Observations On Rock Magnetism,"It seems that in general the plane of maximum magnetic susceptibility lies in the bedding plane for sediments and in the plane of foliation for metamorphic rocks; there is, also, a tendency for the remanent vector to lie in the plane of foliation in the latter. In the case of chemical deposits, the question is raised as to whether the hematite crystal growth is controlled by the magnetic field. Since pure hematite crystals are paramagnetic along the ternary axis, the remanent vector lies in the basal plane perpendicular to this axis, which being the plane of ferromagnetism, is also the plane of maximum susceptibility. We have investigated chemically deposited hematite in the Clinton iron ore of Silurian Age. Although the remanent vector lies close to the plane of maximum susceptibility, this plane, unfortunately, is also the bedding plane. Several other hematite‐bearing formations show a direction of magnetization close to the bedding plane. Measurements of magnetization and susceptibility anisotropy of samples cooled below the transition temperature for hematite have been made with no conclusive results other than indications of the presence of hematite in some cases. Samples from the Hazel formation of pre‐Cambrian Age have been investigated. The planes of maximum susceptibility for this slightly metamorphosed red bed dip at various angles, and thus a system of microfractures containing magnetic material is suggested as a possible explanation. Pole locations for the Clinton iron ore and the Hazel are presented.",10.1190/1.1438469
"Modeling Dolomitized Carbonate‐Ramp Reservoirs: A Case Study Of The Seminole San Andres Unit—Part Ii, Seismic Modeling, Reservoir Geostatistics, And Reservoir Simulation","In part I of this paper, we discussed the rock‐fabric/petrophysical classes for dolomitized carbonate‐ramp rocks, the effects of rock fabric and pore type on petrophysical properties, petrophysical models for analyzing wireline logs, the critical scales for defining geologic framework, and 3-D geologic modeling. Part II focuses on geophysical and engineering characterizations, including seismic modeling, reservoir geostatistics, stochastic modeling, and reservoir simulation. Synthetic seismograms of 30 to 200 Hz were generated to study the level of seismic resolution required to capture the high‐frequency geologic features in dolomitized carbonate‐ramp reservoirs. At frequencies 70 Hz, neither the high‐frequency cycles nor the rock‐fabric units can be identified in seismic data because the tuning thickness of seismic data is much greater than the average thickness of high‐frequency cycles of 6 m. At frequencies 100 Hz, major high‐porosity and dense mudstone units can be better differentiated, while the rock‐fabric units within high‐frequency cycles can be captured at frequencies higher than 200 Hz. Seismic inversion was performed on the 30- to 200-Hz synthetic seismograms to investigate the level of seismic resolution required to recover the high‐resolution inverted impedance logs. When seismic data were noise free, wavelets were known and sampling rates were high; deconvolution techniques yielded perfect inversion results. When the seismic data were noisy, the inverted reflectivity profiles were poor and complicated by numerous high‐frequency spikes, which can be significantly removed using the moving averaging techniques. When wavelets were not known, the predictive deconvolution gave satisfactory inversion results. These results suggest that interwell information required for reservoir characterization can be recovered from low‐frequency seismic data by inversion. Outcrop data were collected to investigate effects of sampling interval and scale‐up of block size on geostatistical parameters. Semivariogram analysis of outcrop data showed that the sill of log permeability decreases and the correlation length increases with an increase of horizontal block size. Permeability models were generated using conventional linear interpolation, stochastic realizations without stratigraphic constraints, and stochastic realizations with stratigraphic constraints. The stratigraphic feature of upward‐shoaling sequences can be modeled in stochastic realizations constrained by the high‐frequency cycles and rock‐fabric flow units. Simulations of a fine‐scale Lawyer Canyon outcrop model were used to study the factors affecting waterflooding performance. Simulation results show that waterflooding performance depends strongly on the geometry and stacking pattern of the rock‐fabric units and on the location of production and injection wells.",10.1190/1.1444480
Optimal Trace Selection For Ava Processing Of Shale-Sand Reservoirs,"When processing data, a principal aim is to maximize information inferred from a data set by minimizing the expected postprocessing uncertainties on parameters of interest. Nonlinear statistical experimental design (SED) methods can be used to find optimal trace profiles for processing amplitude-variation-with-angle (AVA) surveys that account for all prior petrophysical information about the target reservoir. Optimal selections change as prior knowledge of rock parameters and reservoir fluid content changes, and which of the prior parameters have the greatest effect on selected traces can be assessed. The results show that optimal profiles are far more sensitive to prior information about reservoir porosity than to information about saturating fluid properties. By applying ray-tracing methods, AVA results can be used to design optimal processing profiles from seismic data sets for multiple targets, each with different prior-model uncertainties.",10.1190/1.3462291
Anisotropy Of Elastic Wave Velocities In Deformed Shales: Part 1 — Experimental Results,"Elastic wave velocity measurements in the laboratory are used to assess the evolution of the microstructure of shales under triaxial stresses, which are representative of in situ conditions. Microstructural parameters such as crack aperture are of primary importance when permeability is a concern. The purpose of these experiments is to understand the micromechanical behavior of the Callovo-Oxfordian shale in response to external perturbations. The available experimental setup allows for the continuous, simultaneous measurement of five independent elastic wave velocities and two directions of strain (axial and circumferential), performed on the same cylindrical rock sample during deformation in an axisymmetric triaxial cell. The main results are (1) identification of the complete tensor of elastic moduli of the transversely isotropic shales using elastic wave velocity measurements, (2) assessment of the evolution of these moduli under triaxial loading, and (3) assessment of the evolution of the elastic anisotropy under loading in terms of Thomsen's parameters. This last outcome allows us to use the anisotropy of the elastic properties of this rock as an indicator of the evolution of its microstructure. In particular,   ε   in the dry case decreases from 0.5 (ambient pressure) toward 0.37   (55 MPa)  , while   γ   and   δ   are almost insensitive to pressure. In the wet case,   ε   decreases from 0.3 (ambient pressure) toward 0.2   (55 MPa)  . Deviatoric stresses have a strong effect on   ε  ,   γ  , and   δ   variations. In this case,   ε   drops (both for the dry and wet conditions) when failure is approached.",10.1190/1.2952744
Repeatability Study Of Seismic Source Signatures,"This study discusses the repeatability of source signature using the instantaneous phase, as derived from the complex trace attributes. The study is part of a very large 2‐D seismic survey using sources of vibroseis and surface dynamite. The field procedure consisted of recording the production record, retaining the positions, then repeat‐recording the same shake or shot. The instantaneous phase was found to be the best measure for the difference between the first and the repeat records. In addition to the instantaneous phase, other analyses were used to evaluate changes in source signature. Results were tabulated for statistical comparisons and graded for quality. Excluding erroneous cases, the remainder of poor repeatabilities were studied. The analyses of near‐offset data seem to indicate that nonrepeatability of source signature relates mostly to changes in absorption and cohesion induced by elastic saturation at the near surface. In general, by time shifting and phase rotating the repeat record, the difference in instantaneous phase tends to diminish. The new idea of using instantaneous phase difference plots to evaluate repeatability offers improved evaluation of source signatures and can also be used to detect time‐lapsed changes in reservoir monitoring. By evaluating repeatability and avoiding elastic saturation near the surface, source signatures can be made more consistent, thus increasing the resolution of stacked data for 2‐D, 3‐D, and 4‐D seismic surveys.",10.1190/1.1487123
Electromagnetic Interferometry In Wavenumber And Space Domains In A Layered Earth,"With interferometry applied to controlled-source electromagnetic data, the direct field and the airwave and all other effects related to the air-water interface can be suppressed in a data-driven way. Interferometry allows for retreival of the scattered field Green's function of the subsurface or, in other words, the subsurface reflection response. This reflection response can then be further used to invert for the subsurface conductivity distribution. To perform interferometry in 3D, measurements on an areal grid are necessary. We discuss 3D interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution in the frequency-wavenumber and in the frequency-space domains and provide examples for a layered earth model. We use the synthetic aperture source concept to damp the signal at high wavenumbers to allow large receiver sampling distances. Interferometry indeed increases the detectability of a subsurface reservoir. Finally, we discuss the dependency of the accuracy of the retrieved reflection response on the two crucial parameters: the conductivity of the seabed at the receiver location and the stabilization parameter of the least-squares inversion.",10.1190/geo2011-0510.1
Instrumental Arrangement To Measure Gravity With Gradients,"Every mass generates gravity gradients in addition to the gravitational field itself; this fact suggests that vertical gradients may be determined with a gravity measuring device based on a two‐level observation technique (Hammer, 1938; Thyssen‐Bornemisza, 1944). The inverse process, i.e. measurement of gravity or gravitational acceleration with the help of vertical gradients, apparently has not been investigated. Of course, gravity values can be computed from vertical gradients by integration (Paterson, 1961), but to actually measure gravity with vertical gradients is quite a different problem. The theoretical solution presented here provides the background for possible practical application.",10.1190/1.1440125
P-Sv Stacking Charts And Binning Periodicity,"A surface stacking chart (Sheriff and Geldart, 1982; Yilmaz, 1987) is a convenient graphical representation, in source‐receiver space, of the trace geometry for a seismic survey. In this display format, collections of traces corresponding to common‐receiver, common‐source, common‐offset, and common‐midpoint (CMP) gathers are aligned along vertical, horizontal, 45 degree, and 135 degree azimuths (θ), with respect to the receiver axis. Provided that the source spacing (Δs) is an integer multiple of the receiver interval (Δr), traces are exactly aligned in these directions (neglecting skids, detours, etc.). The subsurface multiplicity (fold) along lines of constant CMP is then given by the well known expression.",10.1190/1.1443288
An Inclusion‐Based Model Of Elastic Wave Velocities Incorporating Patch‐Scale Fluid Pressure Relaxation,"We consider elastic wave velocities in fluid‐saturated porous media with pore fluids distributed in ""patches"" (i.e., heterogeneity much larger than the typical pore size). We model elastic properties of such materials using inclusion‐based effective medium theory (IBEMT). The standard IBEMT formulation assumes insufficient time during the wave cycle for pore fluids to flow in response to wave‐induced pressure gradients. Our approach accounts for this flow, incorporating wave‐frequency dependent flow effects in the definition of effective elastic moduli for patches. Effective moduli are used in conjunction with IBEMT to estimate elastic moduli of the composite material. In the low‐ and high‐frequency limits, the model reproduces previous theoretical results. At intermediate frequencies, it yields results qualitatively similar to other patch‐scale models. We demonstrate this approach, estimating elastic P‐wave velocities and attenuation in a porous rock that simultaneously contains fluid‐saturated patches of different sizes.",10.1190/1.1620623
"Geophysical History, Lake St. John Field, Concordia And Tensas Parishes, Louisiana","This paper discusses chronologically the geophysical methods used in discovering the Lake St. John Field in Concordia and Tensas Parishes, Louisiana, and compares the results of these with the structure revealed by subsequent drilling. The discovery well was drilled in 1942 and the field has produced approximately 6,310,000 barrels to date.",10.1190/1.1437326
Explicit 3-D Migration Using Equiripple Polynomial Expansion And Laplacian Synthesis,"In f-x explicit finite‐difference depth migration schemes, wavefield downward extrapolation is carried out through spatial convolution using finite‐length filters. Existing methods for computing these filters are based on nonlinear least‐squares, with a high computational cost, or on Taylor series expansion, which is suboptimal. In the 3-D case, the physics of wavefield extrapolation requires 2-D extrapolation filters with circular symmetry. Recently, McClellan transformation has been used to design circularly symmetric extrapolation operators. But this approach exhibits artifacts when the data are not spatially oversampled. We describe an alternative method to take advantage of the circular symmetry: the radial response of the filter is expanded as a polynomial in the Laplacian, which is synthesized as the sum of two 1-D second‐derivative filters. Using the Laplacian rather than the McClellan transform yields an artifact‐free impulse response for wavenumbers much closer to the Nyquist wavenumber at the same computational cost. Other advantages of the proposed method are the easy extension to a rectangular grid and the possibility of time‐migration implementation. The coefficients of the polynomials are optimized in the L∞ norm, because the stability condition is expressed more easily with this norm. The Remez exchange algorithm, which is a fast L∞ norm spectral synthesis algorithm, is adapted to obtain these L∞‐optimized coefficients of the polynomials, as well as the coefficients of the second derivative filters.",10.1190/1.1444062
Probabilistic Formulation Of Avo Modeling And Avo-Attribute-Based Facies Classification Using Well Logs,"We have developed a probabilistic formulation to derive the probability density function of amplitude variation with offset (AVO) attributes given the distribution of elastic properties, in the context of AVO analysis of well log data. The proposed probabilistic formulation includes the analytical expression of the posterior distribution and contributes to the correct propagation of the uncertainty through the AVO model. When this analysis is performed in each facies, the resulting posterior probability density functions of AVO attributes, conditioned by the elastic attributes and the underlying log-facies classification, can be used in a Bayesian inversion workflow to obtain the AVO-attribute-based facies classification. This classification is then compared with the petrophysical log-facies profile and can be extended to the entire reservoir model if inverted seismic attributes are available. We demonstrate the methodology on a data set from an onshore tight-sand gas reservoir in Texas. The main results of the application are the set of probability distributions of AVO properties as a function of elastic attributes in each facies and the corresponding AVO-based facies profile at the well location. A comparison of different statistical assumptions and a sensitivity analysis on the resolution of the elastic data set are presented.",10.1190/geo2014-0518.1
Multichannel Predictive Deconvolution Based On The Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm,"Multichannel predictive deconvolution can accommodate the lateral variations of subsurface structures to some extent and better preserve primaries than can single-channel predictive deconvolution. To solve the 2D predictive filter, traditional multichannel predictive deconvolution uses the least-squares (LS) algorithm, which requires orthogonality between primaries and multiples. In areas where primaries and multiples overlap, traditional LS-based multichannel predictive deconvolution can cause distorted primaries and residual multiples. To avoid the orthogonality assumption required by the LS algorithm, the iterative reweighted LS (IRLS) algorithm and the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding (FIST) algorithm can be used to solve the prediction filter using the l1 norm. The FIST algorithm uses the shrinkage-thresholding operator to promote the sparsity of estimated primaries and solves the predictive filter with iterative steps. Compared with the IRLS algorithm, the FIST algorithm can reduce the computation burden effectively while achieving similar accuracy. We have used the FIST algorithm for multichannel predictive deconvolution using the l1 norm. Compared with traditional FIST-based single-channel predictive deconvolution and LS-based multichannel predictive deconvolution, our method can better balance primary preservation and multiple removal. Tests using synthetic and field data sets proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.",10.1190/geo2015-0325.1
Ultrasonic Measurements Of Attenuation And Velocity Of Compressional And Shear Waves In Partially Frozen Unconsolidated Sediment And Synthetic Porous Rock,"The presence of partially frozen liquid in the pore spaces of porous materials has significant effects on elastic wave propagation. Although the characterization of partially frozen systems using velocity information has been well developed, application of the attenuation information is limited because the attenuation mechanisms in partially frozen systems are poorly understood. We have conducted ultrasonic wave transmission measurements with changing temperatures from 0°C to −15°C to estimate the effect of partially frozen liquids grown in unconsolidated (unconsolidated sediment) and consolidated (synthetic porous rock) materials on the velocity and attenuation of P- and S-waves. Our experimental results determined that the existence of partially frozen liquid in the unconsolidated and consolidated materials increases the velocity and attenuation for temperatures of 0°C to around the freezing point (i.e., −3°C), thus experimentally validating the unintuitive observations of high velocity and high attenuation. We interpreted the differences in velocity-versus-temperature curves as both the difference in inherent stiffness between the matrix of the consolidated material and the ice frame of the partially frozen unconsolidated material and the microscale ice distribution in pore spaces. We have also attributed the difference in the attenuation-versus-temperature curves in the unconsolidated and consolidated materials between the P- and S-waves to the difference of attenuation mechanism between the P- and S-waves. Our findings can be used for interpreting the velocity and attenuation results from the sonic logging measurements.",10.1190/geo2015-0350.1
Education And The Petroleum Industry,"At a meeting of the Institute of Petroleum held at the Royal Society of Arts in London, April 29, 1943, Professor V. C. Illing, a Vice‐President of the Institute, delivered a paper entitled Education and the Petroleum Industry which was published in the Journal of the Institute of Petroleum, Vol. 29, No. 238, pp. 259–283 (October, 1943).

Asymptotic Expansions For Transient Electromagnetic Fields,"Asymptotic expansions may be derived for transient electromagnetic (EM) fields. The expansions are valid when σμ0l2/t is less than about 0.1. Here l, σ, μ0, and t are the respective lengths, conductivities, permeabilities of free space and time. Cases for which asymptotic expansions are presented include (1) layered grounds, (2) axisymmetric structure, and (3) two‐dimensional (2-D) structures. In all cases the transient voltage eventually approaches that of the host medium alone, the ratio of anomalous response to the half‐space response being proportional to 1/tν. Here v is equal to 0.5 for layered structures and 1.0 for 2-D or 3-D structures.",10.1190/1.1441279
Association Of Magnetic And Density Contrasts With Igneous Rock Classifications,"The frequent co‐existence of strong magnetic and gravity anomalies directs attention to the properties of igneous rocks which may account for them. Density data are direct and unambiguous but magnetic data are much less certain. On the assumption that it is determined by disseminated magnetite, the susceptibility can be estimated from the proportion of magnetite in the rock. The possibility of estimating magnetite content from chemical analyses is examined and while not very satisfactory, it probably gives relative values of some merit. From published chemical analyses the magnetite content and probable intensity of magnetization are calculated for some 1450 samples of igneous rocks, for which density values are also given. The values and resulting contrasts are analyzed statistically and tabulated for the C.I.P.W. and the Iddings methods of classification. The contrasts, thus determined, are in reasonable agreement with expectations from the analysis of magnetometer and gravimeter surveys.",10.1190/1.1445068
"Inversion And Uncertainty Estimation Of Gravity Data Using Simulated Annealing: An Application Over Lake Vostok, East Antarctica","Interpretation of gravity data warrants uncertainty estimation because of its inherent nonuniqueness. Although the uncertainties in model parameters cannot be completely reduced, they can aid in the meaningful interpretation of results. Here we have employed a simulated annealing (SA)–based technique in the inversion of gravity data to derive multilayered earth models consisting of two and three dimensional bodies. In our approach, we assume that the density contrast is known, and we solve for the coordinates or shapes of the causative bodies, resulting in a nonlinear inverse problem. We attempt to sample the model space extensively so as to estimate several equally likely models. We then use all the models sampled by SA to construct an approximate, marginal posterior probability density function (PPD) in model space and several orders of moments. The correlation matrix clearly shows the interdependence of different model parameters and the corresponding trade-offs. Such correlation plots are used to study the effect of a priori information in reducing the uncertainty in the solutions. We also investigate the use of derivative information to obtain better depth resolution and to reduce underlying uncertainties. We applied the technique on two synthetic data sets and an airborne-gravity data set collected over Lake Vostok, East Antarctica, for which a priori constraints were derived from available seismic and radar profiles. The inversion results produced depths of the lake in the survey area along with the thickness of sediments. The resulting uncertainties are interpreted in terms of the experimental geometry and data error.",10.1190/1.1852777
Compression Of Local Slant Stacks By The Estimation Of Multiple Local Slopes And The Matching Pursuit Decomposition,"Because local slant stacking increases the data dimension in beam migration, the volume of local slant stacks can be enormous and can obstruct efficient data processing. In addition, a proper beam compression algorithm can reduce the computation of ray tracing and beam mapping. Thus, compressing the local slant stacks with high fidelity can improve the efficiency of beam migration. A new approach is proposed to efficiently compress the local slant stacks. This approach combines the estimation of multiple local slopes based on the structure tensor to reduce the number of slopes, and the sparse representation for the slant stacked data via the matching pursuit decomposition to reduce the number of temporal samples. Furthermore, a new algorithm to estimate multiple local slopes based on the second-order structure tensor is proposed to handle the intersecting events efficiently. Several data examples indicated that the new compression algorithm required much less storage. Meanwhile, the new algorithm can restore the significant events and tolerate some random noise. The migration results determined that this compression algorithm does not obviously degrade the quality of the beam migration result, and it even makes the migration result more clear by suppressing the random noise smearing.",10.1190/geo2014-0595.1
5D Seismic Data Completion And Denoising Using A Novel Class Of Tensor Decompositions,"We have developed a novel strategy for simultaneous interpolation and denoising of prestack seismic data. Most seismic surveys fail to cover all possible source-receiver combinations, leading to missing data especially in the midpoint-offset domain. This undersampling can complicate certain data processing steps such as amplitude-variation-with-offset analysis and migration. Data interpolation can mitigate the impact of missing traces. We considered the prestack data as a 5D multidimensional array or otherwise referred to as a 5D tensor. Using synthetic data sets, we first found that prestack data can be well approximated by a low-rank tensor under a recently proposed framework for tensor singular value decomposition (tSVD). Under this low-rank assumption, we proposed a complexity-penalized algorithm for the recovery of missing traces and data denoising. In this algorithm, the complexity regularization was controlled by tuning a single regularization parameter using a statistical test. We tested the performance of the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real data to show that missing data can be reliably recovered under heavy downsampling. In addition, we demonstrated that compressibility, i.e., approximation of the data by a low-rank tensor, of seismic data under tSVD depended on the velocity model complexity and shot and receiver spacing. We further found that compressibility correlated with the recovery of missing data because high compressibility implied good recovery and vice versa.",10.1190/geo2014-0467.1
Robust 1D Inversion And Analysis Of Helicopter Electromagnetic (Hem) Data,"Ground-based electrical and electromagnetic methods are used systematically for quantitative hydrogeologic investigations in Denmark. In recent years, a desire for faster and more cost-efficient methods has led to growing interest in the possibility of using airborne systems, and in 2001 a number of test flights were performed using a frequency-domain, helicopter-borne electromagnetic (HEM) system. We perform a theoretical examination of the resolution capabilities of the applied system. Quantitative model parameter analyses show that the system only weakly resolves conductive, near-surface layers but can resolve layer boundary to a depth of more than 100 m. Modeling experiments also show that the effect of altimeter errors on the inversion results is serious. We suggest a new interpretation scheme for HEM data founded solely on full nonlinear 1D inversion and providing layered-earth models supported by data misfit parameters and a quantitative model-parameter analysis. The backbone of the scheme is the removal of cultural coupling effects followed by a multilayer inversion that in turn provides reliable starting models for a subsequent few-layer inversion. A new procedure for correlation in the model space ensures model sections with slow lateral variations in resistivity, normally assumed in sedimentary environments. A field example from a Danish survey demonstrates that the interpretation scheme can produce satisfactory results within the limitations of the system.",10.1190/1.2187752
Rock Physics Analysis And Time-Lapse Rock Imaging Of Geochemical Effects Due To The Injection Of Co2 Into Reservoir Rocks,"The fundamental concept of time-lapse seismic monitoring is that changes in physical parameters—such as saturation, pore fluid pressure, temperature, and stress—affect rock and fluid properties, which in turn alter the seismic velocity and density. Increasingly, however, time-lapse seismic monitoring is called upon to quantify subsurface changes due in part to chemical reactions between injected fluids and the host rocks. This study springs from a series of laboratory experiments and high-resolution images assessing the changes in microstructure, transport, and seismic properties of fluid-saturated sandstones and carbonates injected with CO2. Results show that injecting CO2 into a brine-rock system induces chemo-mechanical mechanisms that permanently change the rock frame. Injecting CO2 into brine-saturated-sandstones induces salt precipitation primarily at grain contacts and within small pore throats. In rocks with porosity lower than 10%, salt precipitation reduces permeability and increases P- and S-wave velocities of the dry rock frame. On the other hand, injecting CO2-rich water into micritic carbonates induces dissolution of the microcrystalline matrix, leading to porosity enhancement and chemo-mechanical compaction under pressure. In this situation, the elastic moduli of the dry rock frame decrease. The results in these two scenarios illustrate that the time-lapse seismic response of chemically stimulated systems cannot be modeled as a pure fluid-substitution problem. A first set of empirical relationships links the time-variant effects of injection to the elastic properties of the rock frame using laboratory velocity measurements and advanced imaging.",10.1190/geo2010-0390.1
Atmospheric Absorption Of 2.62 Mev Gamma‐Ray Photons Emitted From The Ground,"The actual measured decrease in gamma radiation with altitude, as measured by a gamma‐ray spectrometer, was found to be less than predicted on simple theoretical grounds. The various factors which reduced this apparent absorption were Compton scattering in the ground and in the air, the variation of detector efficiency with angle, the mass of material of the aircraft structure and detector housing below the detectors, the dead‐time of the electronic circuitry, and an increase in ground radioactive concentration with depth. When these effects were incorporated, experimental and theoretical values of the linear absorption coefficient in air for 2.62 Mev photons were found to agree.",10.1190/1.1440582
Seismic Radiation From A Point Source On The Surface Of A Cylindrical Cavity,"The presence of a void or cavity in the vicinity of a seismic source will modify the radiated signal from the classic solution for a point force in an infinite medium. To study this effect, solutions were obtained for the seismic fields from a point force applied to the surface of a cylindrical cavity in an elastic medium. The solutions were evaluated to give P‐ and S‐wave frequency domain radiation patterns. For P wavelengths less than about 3 times the cavity diameter, the cavity acts to decrease the P‐wave amplitude going outward in the direction opposite the source. Data taken in two coal mines show this shielding effect. High‐frequency energy was observed, with surface seismometers, for signals generated by hitting the mine roof, whereas the high‐frequency energy was much smaller on signals generated by hitting the floor. Time domain calculations show that the P‐wave signal is delayed by approximately the time it takes an S‐wave to propagate around the cylinder.",10.1190/1.1440879
"Integrated Seismic Analysis: Kidney Area, Northern Alberta, Canada","Integrating various seismic data via simultaneous processing or correlation can increase the accuracy and confidence in subsurface images. To this end, a multioffset VSP survey with simultaneous surface recording was acquired in the fall of 1986 near Red Earth, northern Alberta, in the Kidney prospect area. P‐wave vibrators at three locations west of the survey well were recorded by a downhole three‐component geophone at 15 m increments between depths of 225 m and 1570 m and were recorded simultaneously on a 2900 m surface spread of vertical geophones spaced 25 m apart in line with the VSP sources and just west of the well. These data, along with existing seismic lines and well logs, correlated convincingly and were used to increase confidence in the interpretation of the potential reservoir of interest—a Keg River carbonate (KRC) unit. Tomographic procedures (constrained traveltime inversion) were developed to process simultaneously the well logs, VSP, and surface seismic data. These procedures provided a macroscopic seismic interval velocity in depth. This tomographic velocity structure (TVS) was used in poststack depth migration of an existing seismic line over the region of interest. The resulting depth‐migrated section near the well matched the synthetic seismogram (computed in depth from the sonic log) reasonably well in character and depth for most of the major reflectors. The TVS was also used in a fairly conventional processing flow which included poststack time migration, maximum‐likelihood deconvolution, seismic trace inversion, and time‐to‐depth stretching. The final processed pseudosonic section in depth bore considerable resemblance to the sonic log. About 30 m of KRC was measured from the pseudosonic section, while 35 m of KRC was interpreted from the well logs. The pseudosonic section also strongly suggested thinning or discontinuity in the KRC unit on the section around a previously proposed drilling location (1.7 km west of the well). This interpretation was confirmed by another operator's subsequent drilling at this location, which encountered only 1 m of KRC. The predicted depth of the KRC top (about 1395 m), interpreted from the pseudosonic section at the second well location, was close to the depth (1400 m) on the well logs.",10.1190/1.1442583
Microlaterolog Versus Microlog For Formation Factor Calculations,A comparison of the MicroLaterolog and MicroLog for determining formation resistivity factors indicates that the MicroLaterolog is significantly more accurate. Data supporting this conclusion are presented comparing measured formation resistivity factors from cores with calculated values from the MicroLaterolog and MicroLog in both hard‐ and soft‐rock country. The use of the MicroLaterolog for quantitative electric log interpretation will increase the value of electric logging as an exploration tool.,10.1190/1.1438001
Velocity‐Depth Ambiguity In The Dipping Reflector Case,"Seismic or acoustic wave velocity is a vital parameter for processing and interpretation of seismic data. Various velocity analysis methods, using traveltime moveout of seismic events, have been described in literature. In certain cases, these methods provide ambiguous results. Hence, there is a need to investigate velocity‐depth ambiguity in such cases.",10.1190/1.1444260
Gaussian Beam Depth Migration For Anisotropic Media,"Gaussian beam migration (GBM), as it is implemented today, efficiently handles isotropic inhomogeneous media. The approach is based on the solution of the wave equation in ray‐centered coordinates. Here, I extend the method to work for 2-D migration in generally anisotropic inhomogeneous media. Extension of the Gaussian‐beam method from isotropic to anisotropic media involves modification of the kinematics and dynamics in the required ray tracing. While the accuracy of the paraxial expansion for anisotropic media is comparable to that for isotropic media, ray tracing in anisotropic media is much slower than that in isotropic media. However, because ray tracing is just a small portion of the computation in GBM, the increased computational effort in general anisotropic GBM is typically only about 40%. Application of this method to synthetic examples shows successful migration in inhomogeneous, transversely isotropic media for reflector dips up to and beyond 90°. Further applications to synthetic data of layered anisotropic media show the importance of applying the proper smoothing to the velocity field used in the migration. Also, tests with synthetic data show that the quality of anisotropic migration of steep events in a medium with velocity increasing with depth is much more sensitive to the Thomsen anisotropy parameter ε than to the parameter δ. Thus, a good estimate of ε is needed to apply anisotropic migration with confidence.",10.1190/1.1443881
Temperature Distribution In Salt Domes And Surrounding Sediments,"A straightforward mathematical procedure allows the calculation of the isogeothermal pattern in and about a salt intrusion. Temperature anomalies are controlled not only by the thermal properties of the media, but also are indicative of the geometry and history of the system. As a simple example, an axially symmetrical structure was chosen to illustrate the kind of inferences one can make from the temperature data, such as discrimination between connected and disconnected domes, and the estimation of the vertical velocity of the intrusion. The numerical results confirm and extend the observations in electrolytic scale models (Hubert Guyod, 1946), and augment W. Heroy's comments on thermal properties of salt, given at the International Conference on Saline Deposits, Houston, 1962.",10.1190/1.1439777
"Imaging In 3-D Dmo, Part Ii: Amplitude Effects","The amplitude of the dip‐moveout (DMO) output for a planar reflector at a point P and half offset k is a function of the curvature of the midpoint curve of the DMO input traces, the dip magnitude, and the dip direction. No single weighting function will preserve the amplitude of dipping events. Seismic synthetics on a circle of midpoints minimal data set verify that this data set has 6 dB of amplitude variation with azimuth for a 15° dipping reflector and a 14 dB variation for a 45° reflector. The theory shows that the 3DDMO weight for an arbitrary minimal data set is equal to the impulse response weight multiplied by the density of the normal segments at the dip being imaged. Aliasing is also a function of the normal segment density at the dip being imaged. If the spatial sampling is fine enough to prevent aliasing, DMO can be performed on a dip by dip basis and, by correcting for the normal segment density, these amplitude variations may be corrected.",10.1190/1.1444122
The Output Of Predictive Deconvolution,"The method of predictive deconvolution, with prediction distance greater than unity, is widely used in the oil industry to eliminate multiple reflections from seismic reflection data. When the prediction distance is unity the method corresponds to autoregressive modeling. In this case the output of the deconvolution becomes the reflectivity series of the subsurface for a minimum‐phase wavelet. For prediction distances greater than unity, prediction filters are related recursively (Ulrych et al., 1973). We show that another interesting relationship exists between the autoregressive prediction error operator and the prediction error operator with arbitrary prediction distance. This relationship can be used to investigate the output of predictive deconvolution applied to nonminimum‐phase wavelets. As a consequence, we can show that predictive deconvolution and the phase correction method for Vibroseis data (Ristow and Jurczyk, 1975) are nearly identical.",10.1190/1.1443052
A Blind Interpretation Of Drill‐Bit Signals,"The role of kurtosis in evaluating the quality of vertical seismic profiling (VSP) drill‐bit data is investigated. The calculations show how kurtosis depends on the dominant frequency, bandwidth, and phase content of a seismic signal. This analysis is applied to synthetic and real common‐offset and common‐shot drill‐bit seismograms to evaluate the prominence and quality of the first arrival and other coherent events. High values of kurtosis correspond to an isolated first arrival or to a compressed coherent noise event, while low values are typical of low S/N (distributed) ratio traces. Kurtosis analysis applied to drill‐bit VSP data while drilling proved to be successful at identifying high‐quality traces with little interpretational input.",10.1190/1.1444793
"Magnetic Anomalies And Magnetizations Of The Biwabik Iron‐Formation, Mesabi Area, Minnesota","In a study of the relationship of magnetic anomalies to the magnetite content and structure of layered Precambrian iron‐formations, the effective induced and remanent magnetizations of the Biwabik iron‐formation were determined by analyses of aeromagnetic anomalies recorded 1,000 ft above the Biwabik in areas of known geology. The induced magnetization along the layers is relatively insignificant because the formation is almost perpendicular to the earth's magnetic field. For the relatively unmetamorphosed iron‐formation of the Main Mesabi district, the dominant magnetization was found to be across the layers, about 0.012 gauss, and most likely induced. For the strongly metamorphosed iron‐formation of the East Mesabi district, the dominant magnetization was found to be along the layers, about 0.100 gauss, and remanent. These values are used as bases for explaining aeromagnetic anomalies from correlatives of the Biwabik iron‐formation in the Gunflint, Cuyuna, and Gogebic districts.",10.1190/1.1439073
Translation Invariant Attributes For Effective Lithofacies Discrimination,"This study introduces translation-invariant attributes using the Hadamard and Rapid transforms of seismic data to discriminate lithofacies. Unlike the Fourier transform, which projects the data onto a set of orthogonal sinusoidal waveforms, the Hadamard transform projects data onto a set of square waves called Walsh functions. The Hadamard transform is particularly good at finding repeating, stacked vertical sequences. Crossplot analysis indicates translation-invariant attributes for horizon-based time windows are less sensitive to horizon interpretation errors in the reservoir interval. Therefore, translation-invariant attributes can be used to find a particular geologic pattern of interest in a reservoir interval. These attributes have been applied successfully to discriminate the lithofacies in a reservoir interval of interest for a 3D seismic survey in the upper Assam basin of India. The sand-shale thickness ratio at the drilled locations within the reservoir interval is used to define the lithofacies categories. Using the discriminant function analysis of each of the conventional-seismic, principal-component, and translation-invariant sets of attributes, we create a corresponding discriminant score map. The probability density function (PDF) of the discriminant score at the drilled locations transforms the PDF to lithofacies categories. The comparative analysis presented in this study indicates that translation-invariant attributes are superior to conventional-seismic and principal-component attributes in discriminating the lithofacies.",10.1190/1.2770538
Comparison Of Two Low-Fold 3D Geometries In Saudi Arabia,"Two different 3D seismic survey geometries for relatively low-fold exploration objectives are compared. The sparse geometry (S3D) is executed in swaths using a crew with 960 active channels. It is fast and cost effective, and has been used extensively in Saudi Arabia. The low fold conventional geometry (LFC3D) is acquired in blocks using a crew with about 4000 active channels. LFC3D geometries offer better geophysical attributes, with less variability of offsets and azimuths between common midpoints (CMPs), improved statics control, and higher fold with less source effort. LFC3D geometries have greater flexibility for different survey objectives than S3D geometries, and are competitive with S3D geometries in terms of cost, speed, and data quality.",10.1190/1.2759511
Physical And Numerical Modeling Of Tuning And Diffraction In Azimuthally Anisotropic Media,"Fractured reservoirs are an important target for exploration and production geophysics, and the azimuthal anisotropy often associated with these reservoirs can strongly influence seismic wave propagation. We created a physical model of a fractured reservoir to simulate some of these propagation effects. The reservoir is represented by a phenolite disk that is thin with respect to the elastic wavelengths in the experiment, creating model dimensions that are representative of realistic reservoirs. Phenolite is strongly anisotropic with orthorhombic symmetry, which suggests that azimuthal amplitude versus offset (AVO) effects should be obvious in data. We acquired both SH- and P-wave data in common‐offset gathers with a near offset and a far offset and found that although the SH-wave data show clear azimuthal variations in AVO, the P-wave signals show no apparent changes with azimuth. We then applied numerical modeling to analyze the data. Because ray methods cannot model diffractions from the disk edge, we first used a ray‐Born technique to simulate variations in waveforms associated with such scattering. The synthetic seismograms reproduced variations in the SH-wave waveforms accurately, though the amplitude contrast between acquisition azimuths was overestimated. Assuming a laterally homogeneous model, we then applied ray methods to simulate tuning effects in SH- and P-wave data and confirmed that in spite of the large contrasts in elastic properties, the tuning of the P-wave reflections from the thin disk changed so there was negligible contrast in AVO with azimuth. Models of field scale reservoirs showed that the same effects could be expected for field applications.",10.1190/1.1444849
Weighting Factors In The Construction And Reconstruction Of Acoustical Wave Fields,"The numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation is examined for a separated source and receiver over a model having a single planar interface. Expressions describing the construction and reconstruction of acoustical wave fields are derived in terms of Green's functions. Their relation to the Fourier transform is briefly discussed. Three simple Green's functions—free space, free surface, and rigid surface—are used to test the relative accuracy of the respective weighting factors by comparing the numerically calculated field for a simple model to a field obtained analytically by application of rigorous diffraction theory. The main purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of the total response (amplitude and phase) for models in which the aperture is not sufficiently sampled (e.g., close to half the wavelength). The degree of distortion in the response due to spatial undersampling is unacceptable for all three Green's functions. A modified weighting factor relative to the free‐space Green's function is introduced, which effectively reduces the degree of distortion in the total response under the same sampling condition. The importance of this finding to exploration geophysics in the construction of the synthetic seismograms by application of the Huygen's principle and in seismic migration will be demonstrated.",10.1190/1.1440783

Field Development With Three‐Dimensional Seismic Methods In The Gulf Of Thailand—A Case History,"A three‐dimensional (3-D) marine seismic survey was conducted in the Gulf of Thailand to aid in the development of a gas field indicated by three wildcat wells which had been located by seismic reconnaissance programs shot over a period of several years. The key to successful exploration in the area, basically a hinge line play, was a detailed understanding of the complex faulting controlling the hydrocarbon traps. Since the prospect lies 160–220 km offshore, some specialized surveying techniques were employed to achieve the required positioning accuracy. About 1280 km of seismic data were recorded at 100-m line spacing over a roughly rectangular block covering about 120km2. The 48‐fold data were processed using a 3-D wave equation migration algorithm yielding a set of seismic traces representing the data vertically below a grid of depth points spaced at 3313m by 100 m. The results of the 3-D program showed greater fault resolution and structural delineation. The interpretation developed from a series of horizontal slices provided by the 3-D processing further improved fault resolution. Five wells, drilled on the basis of the 3-D survey, are productive and closely tie the seismic data. Initial studies of amplitude patterns of key reflectors, combined with interval velocities from seismic derived logs, appear to offer the potential of direct detection of productive gas zones thicker than 25 to 30 ft. The 3-D seismic data are being utilized for planning additional development wells and potential platform locations.",10.1190/1.1441325
Removal Of The Detector‐Ground Coupling Effect In The Vertical Seismic Profiling Environment,"In a ""controlled"" experiment with the Gulf VSP tool, the detector‐ground coupling was measured and removed from the recorded signal using the Washburn‐Wiley algorithm. Repeat measurements were made at a common detector depth with two coupling configurations, the first to permit the true ground motion to be recorded and the second to ensure that a coupling resonance existed within the seismic frequency band. The algorithm removed the distortion of the body‐wave portion of the seismogram caused by the coupling resonance for the second configuration and recovered true ground motion. However, lowering the coupling resonance into the seismic band also caused the tool to become sensitive to tube waves. This observation is helpful in evaluating current VSP tools; it implies that any VSP tool that is sensitive to tube waves has a coupling resonance within the seismic frequency band, and that the signal recorded with such a tool does not measure true ground motion. This test also showed that a detector used to monitor source signature variations must have a bandwidth comparable to the VSP signal.",10.1190/1.1442469
Wavefield And Avo Modeling Using Elastic Thin-Slab Method,"The thin-bed AVO and AVOs with lateral parameter variations have been conducted using the thin-slab method and compared with reflectivity and finite-difference methods, respectively. It is shown that the thin-slab method can be used to accurately model reflections for most sedimentary rocks that have intermediate parameter perturbations (  20%   for P-wave velocity and   40%   for S-wave velocity). The combined effects of overburden structure and the scattering associated with heterogeneities on AVO have been investigated using the thin-slab method. Properties of the target zone and overburden structure control the AVO trends at overall offsets. Scattering associated with heterogeneities increases local variance in the reflected amplitudes and becomes significant for the sedimentary models with weak reflections. Interpretation of AVO observations based on homogeneous elastic models would therefore bias the estimated properties of the target. Furthermore, these effects can produce different apparent AVO trends in different offset ranges.",10.1190/1.2227520
Normal Moveout Stretch Mute On Shallow‐Reflection Data,This paper demonstrates the potential consequences of overlooking the significance of allowable stretch ratio when performing normal moveout corrections on shallow‐reflection data. Two shallow reflection data sets with drastically different near‐surface geologic settings conclusively show the significance of subtle changes in allowable stretch mute. An improper stretch mute can reduce the dominant frequency and bandwidth of a stacked reflection by as much as 50 Hz. The sensitivity of shallow reflections to offset may require allowable stretch selection accuracy to be within ± 1 percent. It may be necessary to reduce the fold of an individual stacked shallow reflection by as much as 60 percent to avoid excessive degradation of wavelet properties and consequent loss of resolution. A proper normal moveout stretch mute can reduce distortion of reflection wavelet spectra caused by nonvertical incidence recording to less than 10 percent. Stretched reflection wavelets improperly muted can be misinterpreted on CDP stacked sections as stacked refractions or subtle stratigraphic features.,10.1190/1.1443217
Correlation Of Refraction Shooting,"The theme of this paper is that refraction seismograph investigations making use of techniques and equipment similar to those used for reflection operations can be carried out much more effectively than the older refraction technique of using only first arrivals. The paper is of interest not only because it furnishes a measure of the development of the art in Russia before the war, but also because it contains some thought provoking assertions. The original paper is long (twenty‐two pages in original Russian, ten figures), since it contains a background of theoretical considerations, previous experience, and conceptions leading up to experiments and conclusions which are described, as well as discussion of the merits of the new developments in technique as compared with old technique. Essential features of the experiments, conclusions, and pertinent considerations are given below, without following the order or general arrangement of the original.",10.1190/1.1437218
Effects Of Incomplete Parameterization On Full-Wavefield Viscoelastic Seismic Data For Petrophysical Reservoir Properties,"In inversion of viscoelastic full-wavefield seismic data, the choice of model parameterization influences the uncertainties and biases in estimating seismic and petrophysical parameters. Using an incomplete model parameterization results in solutions in which the effects of missing parameters are attributed erroneously to the parameters that are included. Incompleteness in this context means assuming the earth is elastic rather than viscoelastic. The inclusion of compressional and shear-wave quality factors  Qp  and  Qs  in inversion gives better estimates of reservoir properties than the less complete (elastic) model parameterization.  Qp  and  Qs  are sensitive primarily to fluid types and saturations. The parameter correlations are sensitive also to the model parameterization. As noise increases in the viscoelastic input data, the resolution of the estimated parameters decreases, but the parameter correlations are relatively unaffected by modest noise levels.",10.1190/1.2716631
"3D Seismic Imaging Of Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide Deposits In The Flin Flon Mining Camp, Canada: Part 2 — Forward Modeling","We applied seismic modeling for a detailed 3D geologic model of the Flin Flon mining camp (Canada) to address some imaging and interpretation issues related to a 17‐km2 3D survey acquired in the camp and described in a complementary paper (part 1). A 3D geologic volumetric model of the camp was created based on a compilation of geologic data constraints from drillholes, surface geologic mapping, interpretation of 2D seismic profiles, and 3D surface and grid geostatistical modeling techniques. The 3D modeling methodology was based on a hierarchical approach to account for the heterogeneous spatial distribution of geologic constraints. Elastic parameters were assigned within the model based on core sample measurements and correlation with the different lithologies. The phase-screen algorithm used for seismic modeling was validated against analytic and finite-difference solutions to ensure that it provided accurate amplitude-variation-with-offset behavior for dipping strata. Synthetic data were generated to form zero-offset (stack) volume and also a complete prestack data set using the geometry of the real 3D survey. We found that the ability to detect a clear signature of the volcanogenic massive sulfide with ore deposits is dependent on the mineralization type (pyrite versus pyrrhotite rich ore), especially when ore-host rock interaction is considered. In the presence of an increasing fraction of the host rhyolite rock within the model volume, the response from the lower impedance pyrrhotite ore is masked by that of the rhyolite. Migration tests showed that poststack migration effectively enhances noisy 3D DMO data and provides comparable results to more computationally expensive prestack time migration. Amplitude anomalies identified in the original 3D data, which were not predicted by our modeling, could represent potential exploration targets in an undeveloped part of the camp, assuming that our a priori earth model is sufficiently accurate.",10.1190/geo2011-0474.1
Unified Theory Of Global Flow And Squirt Flow In Cracked Porous Media,"Approximations for frequency-dependent and complex-valued effective stiffness tensors of cracked porous media (saturated with a single fluid) are developed on the basis of an inclusion-based model (the T-matrix approach to rock physics) and a unified treatment of the global-flow and squirt-flow mechanisms. Essentially, this study corrects an inconsistency or error related to fluid-mass conservation in an existing expression for the t-matrix (wave-induced deformation) of a communicating cavity, a cavity that is isolated with respect to stress propagation (through the solid matrix) but that can exchange fluid mass with other cavities because of global and/or local pressure gradients associated with passage of a long viscoelastic wave. An earlier demonstration of Gassmann consistency remains valid because the new theory of global flow and squirt flow (which also takes into account solid mechanical effects of stress interaction by us-ing products of communicating t-matrices associated with two-point correlation functions of ellipsoidal symmetry) only differs from an earlier version by a correction term that goes to zero in the low-frequency limit. If the unified model is applied to the special case of a model involving a single set of spheroidal cavities (having the same aspect ratio and orientation), the results become identical with those obtained using a special theory of global flow that predicts that at zero frequency the cavities will behave as though they are isolated with respect to wave-induced fluid flow (in accordance with Gassmann's formulas) and that at high frequencies, they will behave as though they are dry. Our theory predicts that there will be a continuous transition from a global-flow-dominated system (characterized by a negative velocity dispersion) to a squirt-flow-dominated system (characterized by a positive velocity dispersion) if one begins with a single set of cavities and then introduces a distribution of shapes and/or orientations that gradually becomes wider (more realistic).",10.1190/1.3078404
Traveltime And Amplitude Calculations Using The Damped Wave Solution,"Because of its computational efficiency, prestack Kirchhoff depth migration remains the method of choice for all but the most complicated geological depth structures. Further improvement in computational speed and amplitude estimation will allow us to use such technology more routinely and generate better images. To this end, we developed a new, accurate, and economical algorithm to calculate first‐arrival traveltimes and amplitudes for an arbitrarily complex earth model. Our method is based on numerical solutions of the wave equation obtained by using well‐established finite‐difference or finite‐element modeling algorithms in the Laplace domain, where a damping term is naturally incorporated in the wave equation. We show that solving the strongly damped wave equation is equivalent to solving the eikonal and transport equations simultaneously at a fixed reference frequency, which properly accounts for caustics and other problems encountered in ray theory. Using our algorithm, we can easily calculate first‐arrival traveltimes for given models. We present numerical examples for 2‐D acoustic models having irregular topography and complex geological structure using a finite‐element modeling code.",10.1190/1.1512811
"First Results Of The Moses Experiment: Sea Sediment Conductivity And Thickness Determination, Bute Inlet, British Columbia, By Magnetometric Offshore Electrical Sounding","A static electrical method has been developed to determine the electrical resistivity of crustal rock beneath the sea. The transmitter is a vertical, long‐wire bipole, extending from the sea surface to the sea floor. A commutated current, generated on the ship, is fed to two large electrodes: one near the sea surface, the other at the end of a long insulated wire. The return path for the current is through the sea and the subjacent crust. The receiver is a self‐contained, remote, microprocessor‐controlled magnetometer which is deployed from the ship to the sea floor and subsequently recovered. The data are measurements of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field as a function of transmitter‐receiver horizontal separation. The acronym MOSES has been coined for the method. The choice of the name MOSES is appropriate because the system geometry is carefully arranged to remove many of the adverse effects of the relatively conductive sea water. In particular, accurate estimates of sea floor resistivity are possible because the data are proportional to the transmitted current from the source into the crustal material. A sea test of the method in a water depth of 640 m was conducted in the ""V"" shaped Bute Inlet, British Columbia. Transmitted power was 1.25 kW; averaging time at each transmitter location was 1 hour. Transmitter‐receiver separations ranged from 150 to 2 000 m. The resistivity and thickness of a sedimentary section beneath the sea were determined as 1.9⋅Ω m and 560 m, respectively. The interpretation was accomplished both by matching the data converted to apparent resistivity to corresponding model type curves and by generalized linear inverse theory. Errors in the final parameters were estimated at about 9.2 percent using a parameter eigenvector analysis. The interpreted resistivity is in accord with direct measurement on core samples of sediment porosity. The interpreted thickness is less than an upper limit determined by extrapolating local inlet topography beneath the sea.",10.1190/1.1441825
Electric Field Of An Oscillating Dipole On The Surface Of A Two Layer Earth,"Dr. Wolf's rigorous solution of the problem of a dipole oscillator on the surface of a homogeneous earth shows Ey independent of frequency. Field measurements show Ey dependent on frequency in a manner agreeing with the solution of a dipole oscillator in a homogeneous medium. The disagreement of the measurements with the more rigorous theory, and the agreement with theory that neglects the air‐earth boundary is paradoxical.",10.1190/1.1437284
Multiresolution Parameterization For Geophysical Inverse Problems,"A model parameterization based on a multiresolution wavelet representation is proposed for geophysical inverse problems in this study. The matrix equation for the wavelet representation of the model is constructed by dual wavelet transforms of a readily built matrix based on the pixel parameterization. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed parameterization using the simple examples of geophysical data gridding and 3D seismic tomography, and comparing the results with those obtained by the conventional pixel parameterization. It is shown that for the conventional damped least‐squares solutions of pixel‐parameterized models, regularization by norm damping deteriorates the underlying model correlation due to sparse and heterogeneous sampling, whereas roughness damping schemes impose a priori arbitrary correlation length irrespective of the heterogeneous sampling. The scale hierarchy embedded in the proposed multiresolution parameterization facilitates the compromise between the dual spatial and scale resolution. Depending on the local richness of the data constraints across different scales at a site, model variation of various scale spectra can be robustly resolved through the scale hierarchy. There is thus no need to invoke additional smoothness regularization.",10.1190/1.1543207

Singular-Value Decomposition Analysis Of Source Illumination In Seismic Interferometry By Multidimensional Deconvolution,"We have developed a method to analytically evaluate the relationship between the source-receiver configuration and the retrieved wavefield in seismic interferometry performed by multidimensional deconvolution (MDD). The MDD method retrieves the wavefield with the desired source-receiver configuration from the observed wavefield without source information. We used a singular-value decomposition (SVD) approach to solve the inverse problem of MDD. By introducing SVD into MDD, we obtained quantities that revealed the characteristics of the MDD inverse problem and interpreted the effect of the initial source-receiver configuration for a survey design. We numerically simulated the wavefield with a 2D model and investigated the rank of the incident field matrix of the MDD inverse problem. With a source array of identical length, a sparse and a dense source distribution resulted in an incident field matrix of the same rank and retrieved the same wavefield. Therefore, the optimum source distribution can be determined by analyzing the rank of the incident field matrix of the inverse problem. In addition, the introduction of scatterers into the model improved the source illumination and effectively increased the rank, enabling MDD to retrieve a better wavefield. We found that the ambiguity of the wavefield inferred from the model resolution matrix was a good measure of the amount of illumination of each receiver by the sources. We used the field data recorded at the two boreholes from the surface sources to support our results of the numerical modeling. We evaluated the rank of incident field matrix with the dense and sparse source distribution. We discovered that these two distributions resulted in an incident field matrix of almost the same rank and retrieved almost the same wavefield as the numerical modeling. This is crucial information for designing seismic experiments using the MDD-based approach.",10.1190/geo2012-0245.1
The Analysis Of Multichannel Airborne Gamma‐Ray Spectra,"Experimental potassium, uranium, and thorium gamma‐ray spectra covering a range of equivalent aircraft altitudes from 0 to 112 m were derived from measurements on large radioactive concrete calibration pads using plywood sheets to simulate the absorption effects of the air. A mathematical analysis of all three radioelement spectra showed they are composed of two basic spectral components which are added in different proportions dependent on the altitude of the aircraft above the ground. Above an energy of 0.662 MeV, the two‐component spectral model represented accurately the observed gamma‐ray spectrum from the ground. Below this particular energy, cesium-137 from atomic weapons fallout was found to contribute significantly to the airborne spectra. A theoretical analysis of the calculated spectrum from typical crustal material showed that by multispectral fitting above the cesium-137 energy, the thorium and uranium concentration errors could be reduced by approximately 25 percent compared to the standard three‐window method. Similar increases in accuracy were found experimentally by analyzing a series of 1 s airborne data recorded over a uniformly radioactive test strip. The two‐component model was also used to investigate the effect of changing the windows on the standard three‐window method. For typical crustal material, no significant increase in uranium accuracy was achieved by changing the windows from those recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",10.1190/1.1441886
Advanced Inversion Methods For Airborne Electromagnetic Exploration,"Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys can contribute substantially to geologic mapping and target identification if good‐quality multifrequency data are produced, properly evaluated, and displayed. A set of multifrequency EM data is transformed into a set of apparent resistivity (ρa) and centroid depth (zp*) values, which then are plotted as a sounding curve. These ρa(zp*) curves commonly provide a smoothed picture of the vertical resistivity distribution at the sounding site. We have developed and checked methods to enhance the sensitivity of sounding curves to vertical resistivity changes by using new definitions for apparent resistivity and centroid depth. One of these new sounding curves with enhanced sensitivity to vertical resistivity contrasts is plotted from ρNB, zs* values derived from differentiation of the ρa(f) curve with respect to the frequency f. This approach is similar to the Niblett‐Bostick transform used in magnetotellurics. It not only enhances vertical changes in resistivity but also increases the depth of investigation. Sounding curves can be calculated directly from EM survey data and can be used to generate a resistivity‐depth parasection. Based on such a section, it can be decided whether a Marquardt‐type inversion of the AEM data into a 1-D layered half‐space model is adequate. Each sounding curve can be transformed into an initial step model of resistivity as required for the Marquardt inversion. We have inverted data from sedimentary sequences with good results. For data from a dipping conducting layer and a dipping plate, we have found that the results depend on the right choice of the starting model, in which the number of layers should be large rather than too small. Complex resistivity structures, however, often are represented better by using the sounding‐curve results than with the parameters of a layered half‐space.",10.1190/1.1444882
Automatic Time-Domain Velocity Estimation Based On An Accelerated Clustering Method,"Time-domain velocity and moveout parameters can be directly obtained from local event slopes, which are estimated on the prestack seismic gathers. In practice, there are always some errors in the estimated local slopes, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) situations. Thus, subsurface velocity information may be hidden in the image domain spanned by velocity and other moveout parameters. We have developed an accelerated clustering algorithm to find cluster centers without prior information about the number of clusters. First, plane-wave destruction is implemented to estimate the local event slopes. For every sample in the seismic gathers, we obtain the estimations of velocity and its location in the image domain, according to the local event slopes. These mapped data points in the new domain exhibit the structure of groups. We represent these points by a mixture distribution model. Then, the cluster centers of the mixture distribution model are located, which correspond to maximum likelihood velocities of the main subsurface structures. Approximate velocity uncertainties bounds are used to select centers corresponding to reflections. Finally, interpolation is performed on the clustered unevenly sampled knot velocities to build the effective velocity model on regular grids. With synthetic and field data examples, we have determined that the proposed automatic velocity estimation method can give a stacking velocity model and a time migration velocity model with relatively high accuracy.",10.1190/geo2015-0313.1
A Monte Carlo Approach To The Joint Estimation Of Reservoir And Elastic Parameters From Seismic Amplitudes,"Inversion of seismic data and quantification of reservoir properties, such as porosity, lithology, or fluid saturation, are commonly executed in two consecutive steps: a geophysical inversion to estimate the elastic parameters and a petrophysical inversion to estimate the reservoir properties. We combine within an integrated formulation the geophysical and petrophysical components of the problem to estimate the elastic and reservoir properties jointly. We solve the inverse problem following a Monte Carlo sampling approach, which allows us to quantify the uncertainties of the reservoir estimates accounting for the combination of geophysical data uncertainties, the deviations of the elastic properties from the calibrated petrophysical transform, and the nonlinearity of the geophysical and petrophysical relations. We implement this method for the inference of the total porosity and the acoustic impedance in a reservoir area, combining petrophysical and seismic information. In our formulation, the porosity and impedance are related with a statistical model based on the Wyllie transform calibrated to well-log data. We simulate the seismic data using a convolutional model and evaluate the geophysical likelihood of the joint porosity-impedance models. Applying the Monte Carlo sampling method, we generate a large number of realizations that jointly explain the seismic observations and honor the petrophysical information. This approach allows the calculation of marginal probabilities of the model parameters, including medium porosity, impedance, and seismic source wavelet. We show a synthetic validation of the technique and apply the method to data from an eastern Venezuelan hydrocarbon reservoir, satisfactorily predicting the medium stratification and adequate correlation between the seismic inversion and well-log estimates for total porosity and acoustic impedance.",10.1190/1.2783766
Critical Porosity And Elastic Properties Of Microporous Mixed Carbonate-Siliciclastic Rocks,"By integrating elastic-property measurements and quantitative mineralogic and petrographic analyses of 45 mixed carbonate-siliciclastic samples from two wells drilled in Late Cretaceous rock of the South Provence Basin (southeast France), we can (1) identify and quantify the parameters controlling elastic properties; (2) demonstrate that micrite can be considered as a porous medium with a low critical porosity, averaging 18%; and (3) relate diagenetic transformations, pore-structure modifications, and elastic-property changes. Microporous carbonates with compact anhedral and euhedral microrhombic micrites display a steeper decrease in compressional and shear velocities with increasing porosity than do carbonate rocks with moldic, intergranular, or intercrystalline macroporosity. The low value of critical porosity estimated in micrites (18%), as well as the steep slopes of velocity-porosity relationships at low porosity, is believed to result from a pore-network geometry characterized by very flat, thin pores bounded by planar faces of micrite crystals. Cementation of microrhombic micrite steeply increases elastic moduli, whereas dissolution processes significantly increase porosity with low variations of elastic moduli. Thus, critical-porosity concepts can help describe and model elastic properties of micritic microporous carbonate.",10.1190/1.3043727
Principle Of Reverse‐Time Migration,"At the Migration Research Workshop of the 52nd SEG Meeting in Dallas (1982), an elegant method of wave‐equation migration, known as reverse‐time migration, was presented by Whitmore. Shortly thereafter McMechan (1982, 1983) and Baysal (1982) described virtually identical approaches to migration. This, along with further development by Baysal et al (1983a,b) and Whitmore (1983), has sparked much interest and discussion. In May 1983, Loewenthal and Mufti also published a migration algorithm, quite different from the above, that they call ""reversed time migration"" and developed as early as 1977. In this short note I present a general principle underlying reverse‐time migration and discuss the various reverse‐time migration procedures in light of it.",10.1190/1.1441693
Seismograph Evidence On The Depth Of The Salt In Southern Mississippi,"Reflection seismograph records shot over the tops of shallow salt domes in Southern Mississippi show deep events which can reasonably be identified as reflections from the base of the salt. Calculations reveal the depth to the bottom of the salt mass to be approximately 22,000 to 26,000 feet.",10.1190/1.1445025
The Gulf Seismic Profile Printer,"A seismic recording system has been developed in which seismic sections, printed photographically in variable‐density form, simulate geologic cross‐sections. The seismic signals recorded from geophone stations arranged for continuous reflection center‐point control are presented in a sequence of vertical tracks. The tracks are adjusted for known corrections and reproduced at a selected horizontal scale. Prints of the variable‐density section exhibit all events and their interrelationships for ready recognition and appraisal. The printer mechanism reduces seismic information to a uniform time basis, with weathering and elevation corrections to datum, and with stepout corrections in which account is taken of changing wave‐front velocity with vertical travel‐path time. The original field records comprise variable‐density tracks on strips of 70‐mm film. In the printer, individual record tracks are successively scanned and transferred to a continuous sheet of film by contact printing. Punched cards supply correction data to mechanisms which displace each record track according to the desired corrections. Normal and special printing functions are automatically performed.",10.1190/1.1438361
Letter To The Editor: Utilization Of S.P. Data In Evaluating Velocity Functions,"The paper ""A Velocity Function In cluding Lithologic Variation"" (Geophysics, Vol. 18, pp. 271-288, 1953) suggested that a specific velocity function should be of the form of Equation (11) of that paper. The penultimate paragraph mentioned that a suggestion offered by D r. L. de Witte might be useful in evalu ting equation (II).",10.1190/1.18040001.1
High-Resolution Coherency Functionals For Velocity Analysis: An Application For Subbasalt Seismic Exploration,"We tested the properties of three different coherency functionals for the velocity analysis of seismic data relative to subbasalt exploration. We evaluated the performance of the standard semblance algorithm and two high-resolution coherency functionals based on the use of analytic signals and of the covariance estimation along hyperbolic traveltime trajectories. Approximate knowledge of the wavelet was exploited to design appropriate filters that matched the primary reflections, thereby further improving the ability of the functionals to highlight the events of interest. The tests were carried out on two synthetic seismograms computed on models reproducing the geologic setting of basaltic intrusions and on common midpoint gathers from a 3D survey. Synthetic and field data had a very low signal-to-noise ratio, strong multiple contamination, and weak primary subbasalt signals. The results revealed that high-resolution coherency functionals were more suitable than semblance algorithms to detect primary signals and to distinguish them from multiples and other interfering events. This early discrimination between primaries and multiples could help to target specific signal enhancement and demultiple operations.",10.1190/geo2012-0544.1
Viscous Deformation Of Unconsolidated Reservoir Sands—Part 2: Linear Viscoelastic Models,"Laboratory creep experiments show that dry unconsolidated reservoir sands follow a power law function of time (at constant stress), and cyclic loading tests (at quasi‐static frequencies of 10−6 to 10−2 Hz) show that the bulk modulus increases by a factor of two with increasing frequency while attenuation remains constant. In this paper, we attempt to model these observations using linear viscoelasticity theory by considering several simple phenomenological models. We investigated two classes of models: spring‐dashpot models, which are represented by exponential functions with a single relaxation time, and power law models. Although almost all of the models considered were capable of fitting the creep data with time, they result in very different predictions of attenuation and bulk modulus dispersion. We used the model parameters derived from fitting the creep strain to predict the bulk modulus dispersion and attenuation as a function of frequency, to find a single phenomenological model (and model parameters) that could explain the material's creep response with time as well as its dispersion and attenuation characteristics. Spring‐dashpot models, such as the Burgers and standard linear solid models, produce reasonable fits to the creep strain and bulk modulus dispersion data, but do not reproduce the attenuation data. We find that a combined power law–Maxwell creep model adequately fits all of the data. Extrapolating the power law–Maxwell creep model out to 30 years (to simulate the lifetime of a reservoir) predicts that the static bulk modulus is only 25% of the dynamic modulus. Including the instantaneous component of deformation into the previous prediction results in 2% total vertical strain at the wellbore, in good agreement with field observations.",10.1190/1.1759460
"Frequency‐Domain Acoustic‐Wave Modeling And Inversion Of Crosshole Data: Part Ii—Inversion Method, Synthetic Experiments And Real‐Data Results","In full‐wave inversion of seismic data in complex media it is desirable to use finite differences or finite elements for the forward modeling, but such methods are still prohibitively expensive when implemented in 3-D. Full‐wave 2-D inversion schemes are of limited utility even in 2-D media because they do not model 3-D dynamics correctly. Many seismic experiments effectively assume that the geology varies in two dimensions only but generate 3-D (point source) wavefields; that is, they are ""two‐and‐one‐half‐dimensional"" (2.5-D), and this configuration can be exploited to model 3-D propagation efficiently in such media. We propose a frequency domain full‐wave inversion algorithm which uses a 2.5-D finite difference forward modeling method. The calculated seismogram can be compared directly with real data, which allows the inversion to be iterated. We use a descents‐related method to minimize a least‐squares measure of the wavefield mismatch at the receivers. The acute nonlinearity caused by phase‐wrapping, which corresponds to time‐domain cycle‐skipping, is avoided by the strategy of either starting the inversion using a low frequency component of the data or constructing a starting model using traveltime tomography. The inversion proceeds by stages at successively higher frequencies across the observed bandwidth. The frequency domain is particularly efficient for crosshole configurations and also allows easy incorporation of attenuation, via complex velocities, in both forward modeling and inversion. This also requires the introduction of complex source amplitudes into the inversion as additional unknowns. Synthetic studies show that the iterative scheme enables us to achieve the theoretical maximum resolution for the velocity reconstruction and that strongly attenuative zones can be recovered with reasonable accuracy. Preliminary results from the application of the method to a real data set are also encouraging.",10.1190/1.1443818
Localization And Backscattering Spectrum Of Seismic Waves In Stratified Lithology,"Using four sonic well logs from diverse geological environments, we analyze the statistics of lithological layers relevant to seismic wave propagation. The autocorrelation functions are found to be well approximated by exponentials with correlation lengths generally in the 1.5 to 3 m range. We use localization theory to calculate the apparent attenuation caused by random scattering as a function of frequency. This attenuation has a peak at 50 to 150 Hz with a corresponding localization length of 1.6 to 4.8 km (1 to 3 mi) and an apparent Q of 120 to 450. At seismic frequencies (20 Hz) the attenuation is smaller, with localization lengths in the 16 to 32 km (10 to 20 mi) range and an apparent Q of 300 to 700. These values of apparent Q are consistent with observations of previous authors who used well‐log calculations. Using finite differences we compute synthetic traces for a 20-Hz pulse with multiple backscattering from the lithology given by each of the well logs. The power spectral density of the trace is computed for different time gates and compared with theoretical predictions. The nonwhite, f2 dependence of the spectrum as predicted by theory is confirmed. Furthermore, when plotted as a function of the scaled variable inversely proportional to the localization length, the average of the four power spectra exhibits excellent agreement with the dimensionless scaling function derived using localization theory.",10.1190/1.1442932
A Generalized Multibody Model For Inversion Of Magnetic Anomalies,"The height of the observation surface above a magnetized region primarily determines the critical dimension of the smallest inhomogeneity in magnetization that can be resolved from magnetic survey data. When a rectangular block is smaller in size than this critical dimension, it appears homogeneously magnetized in the observed magnetic field. This consideration leads to the selection of a unit rectangular block of suitable dimensions with homogeneous magnetization. The magnetized region creating the anomalous field values in the area of observation can, therefore, be broken up into several blocks having different magnetizations, each block being equal in size  and uniformly magnetized. The iterative method described here assumes initially that the anomalous field values are caused by a three‐dimensional (3-D) distribution of magnetized rectangular blocks. The optimum orientation of these blocks with respect to geographic north is then determined. This orientation is particularly insensitive to adjustments in the dimensions of the blocks. The top and bottom surfaces of each of the blocks in one or more layers are adjusted in a least‐squares sense to minimize the difference between observed and calculated field values. A method is also described for constraining the magnetization vector of each block to lie within a specified angle of the normal or reversed direction of the geomagnetic field vector. The procedure for analysis of data can also be extended to the case of anomalies over a draped surface. At the conclusion of the iterations, a 3-D distribution of magnetization is generated to delineate the magnetized region responsible for the observed anomalous magnetic field. Examples including model and aeromagnetic data are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of a generalized multibody model for inversion of magnetic anomalies.",10.1190/1.1441081
The Poulter Seismic Method Of Geophysical Exploration,The Poulter seismic method is outlined and an analysis is made of the frequency distribution of seismic energy from different sources. The effect of different sources upon the directivity of the energy in the ground and the improvement that can be obtained in signal‐to‐noise ratio is discussed. Three different methods are described for controlling the frequency of the seismic impulses being introduced into the ground and the resulting improvement in the quality of records is illustrated. The almost complete elimination of multiple reflections by the method is indicated.,10.1190/1.1437589
Toward Phenomenological Universality Of The Mechanical Behavior Of Arbitrarily Anisotropic Porous Rocks,"The great diversity of the microstructures of rocks impedes the use of a universal rock physics model with idealized geometry to correctly describe the mechanical behavior of rocks. In this quest for universality, by ignoring the detailed description of the causes of the observed phenomenon and only focusing on the empirical relation between the cause (applied stress) and the effect (resulting strain), phenomenological models such as the linear elastic Hooke's law roughly describe the mechanical behavior of rocks of contrasted microstructures. However, in detail, numerous laboratory experiments covering broad frequency and strain ranges (both typically more than eight orders of magnitude) on various types of rocks have also shown deviations from Hooke's law due to anisotropy, frequency dependence, nonlinearity, possibly with the presence of hysteresis, and poroelasticity. A phenomenological model has been recently proposed that synthesizes all these behaviors in a single model, but unfortunately does not integrate the porous nature of rocks. The new model is based on a reformulation in modified spectral decomposition of the previous work using the 7D poroelastic tensor linking the dynamic parameters (i.e., the six stress components and fluid pressure) and the kinematic parameters (i.e., the six strain components and the local increase of fluid content ζ). In addition to the elastic hysteresis of the stress-strain curves, the model also predicts the existence of a second hysteresis, or hydraulic hysteresis, of the curve fluid pressure p versus fluid content ζ, qualitatively similar to the first one. Indeed, the elastic hysteresis is due to the opening and the closure of some compliant pores at different stress levels. These pores represent possible access radii for the saturating fluid; the hysteresis in the geometry of the porous network also induces the hydraulic hysteresis in the p-ζ curves.",10.1190/1.3560166
Twelve Years Of Vertical Birefringence In Nine‐Component Vsp Data,"Since 1986, when industry scientists first publicly showed data supporting the presence of azimuthal anisotropy in sedimentary rock, we have studied vertical shear‐wave (S-wave) birefringence in 23 different wells in western North America. The data were from nine‐component vertical seismic profiles (VSPs) supplemented in recent years with data from wireline crossed‐dipole logs. This paper summarizes our results, including birefringence results in tabular form for 54 depth intervals in 19 of those 23 wells. In the Appendix we present our conclusions about how to record VSP data optimally for study of vertical birefringence. We arrived at four principal conclusions about vertical S-wave birefringence. First, birefringence was common but not universal. Second, birefringence ranged from 0–21%, but values larger than 4% occurred only in shallow formations (1200 m) within 40 km of California's San Andreas fault. Third, at large scales birefringence tended to be blocky. That is, both the birefringence magnitude and the S-wave polarization azimuth were often consistent over depth intervals of several tens to hundreds of meters but then changed abruptly, sometimes by large amounts. Birefringence in some instances diminished with depth and in others increased with depth, but in almost every case a layer near the surface was more birefringent than the layer immediately below it. Fourth, observed birefringence patterns generally do not encourage use of multicomponent surface reflection seismic data for finding fractured hydrocarbon reservoirs, but they do encourage use of crossed‐dipole logs to examine them. That is, most reservoirs were birefringent, but none we studied showed increased birefringence confined to the reservoir.",10.1190/1.1444950
Electrical Nonlinear Phenomena In Rocks,"Evidence is presented in this paper on the electrical nonlinear phenomena occurring above a certain charge density at the electrode plates (critical charge density, qcr) for a serpentinite sample with dry electrode contact and a galena sample using moist electrode contact. The critical charge density for the serpentinite sample is 10-8 Coulombs/cm2. In terms of critical current density, it is 3.1×10-10amp/cm2 at 10-2 hz, or 3.1×10-7amp/cm2 at 10 hz. The galena sample shows two critical charge densities, where one is 6.0×10-7Coulombs/cm2 and the other is 8.0×10-5Coulombs/cm2. In terms of critical current density, it is 1.9×10-8amp/cm2 at 10-2 hz, or 1.9×10-5amp/cm2 at 10 hz for the first critical charge. The concept of ""critical charge and nonlinearity"" is similar to that of ""decomposition voltage"" of electrodes immersed in an electrolyte. The decomposition voltage is a characteristic of conductors immersed in liquids, and it varies according to the type of conductor. It is thus possible that the nonlinear study of minerals could form a basis of a new geophysical technique, especially in borehole logging, for detecting not only the existence, but also the type, of minerals in the ground.",10.1190/1.1440323
Joint Inversion Of Em And Magnetic Data For Near‐Surface Studies,"Magnetic and electromagnetic measurements are influenced by magnetic susceptibility and, thus, are widely used in geophysical surveys for archeology or pedology. To date, the data inversion is performed separately. A filtering process incorporating both types of data is presented here. After testing the algorithm with synthetic data, the algorithm is used in several case studies in archeological prospecting. This approach presents two advantages: establishing the presence of remanent magnetizations (viscous or thermoremanent), and achieving more refined depth analysis of the anomaly.",10.1190/1.1527074
Sh-Wave Propagation In Heterogeneous Media: Velocity‐Stress Finite‐Difference Method,"A new finite‐difference (FD) method is presented for modeling SH-wave propagation in a generally heterogeneous medium. This method uses both velocity and stress in a discrete grid. Density and shear modulus are similarly discretized, avoiding any spatial smoothing. Therefore, boundaries will be correctly modeled under an implicit formulation. Standard problems (quarter‐plane propagation, sedimentary basin propagation) are studied to compare this method with other methods. Finally a more complex example (a salt dome inside a two‐layered medium) shows the effect of lateral propagation on seismograms recorded at the surface. A corner wave, always in‐phase with the incident wave, and a head wave will appear, which will pose severe problems of interpretation with the usual vertical migration methods.",10.1190/1.1441605
"Structural Uncertainties: Determination, Management, And Applications",Our scheme generates many equiprobable realizations of the structural model provided that each source of uncertainty has been described in terms of magnitude direction and correlation length. These realizations may then be used to quantify risk in exploration development and drilling.,10.1190/1.1484528
Robust Modeling With Erratic Data,"An attractive alternative to least‐squares data modeling techniques is the use of absolute value error criteria. Unlike the least‐squares techniques the inclusion of some infinite blunders along with the data will hardly affect the solution to an otherwise well‐posed problem. An example of this great stability is seen when an average is, determined by using the median rather than the arithmetic mean. Algorithms for absolute error minimization are often approximately as costly as least‐squares algorithms; however, unlike least‐squares, they naturally lend themselves to inequality or bounding constraints on models.",10.1190/1.1440378
Using Homotopy To Invert Geophysical Data,"Homotopy is a powerful tool for solving nonlinear equations. It is used here to solve small‐dimensional geophysical inverse problems by locating the solutions of the governing normal equations. An Euler‐Newton numerical continuation scheme is used to map trajectories in model space that start from a prescribed solution to a trivial set of equations and terminate at a solution to the inverse problem. The trajectories often map out a continuum of equivalent solutions that are caused by model equivalences or overparameterization. This allows exploration of the solution space topology. The homotopy method, in this application, is relatively insensitive to the choice of starting model. Several examples based on synthetic controlled‐source electromagnetic (CSEM) responses are shown to illustrate the method. An inversion of actual CSEM data from the Canadian Shield is also provided.",10.1190/1.1487117
Electrical Resistivity And Chemical Properties Of Kerogen Isolated From Organic-Rich Mudrocks,"Low electrical resistivity measurements in organic-rich mudrocks are commonplace in highly mature zones. These low resistivity values are usually difficult to justify and lead to overestimation of water saturation when using conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models (e.g., dual water and Waxman-Smits). Previous publications suggest that the electrical conductivity of kerogen increases when it thermally matures. This increase in thermal maturity of kerogen might contribute to low resistivity measurements in organic-rich mudrocks. However, electrical properties of kerogen within these rocks have not yet been quantified experimentally. We have introduced a technique to quantify electrical resistivity of kerogen through combined experimental and numerical approaches and quantified electrical resistivity of kerogen samples from the Haynesville and Eagle Ford Formations. We first isolated kerogen from mudrock samples using physical and chemical treatments. The isolated kerogen powder was then compressed into a homogeneous disk. Then, we synthetically matured mudrock and kerogen samples to controlled maturity levels and measured the electrical resistivity and geochemical properties of each sample. The true electrical resistivity of kerogen was then estimated by minimizing the difference between the numerically simulated and measured electrical resistivity of the molded kerogen samples. We have observed a significant decrease in the electrical resistivity of kerogen isolated from the Haynesville (i.e., up to four orders of magnitude) and Eagle Ford (i.e., up to nine orders of magnitude) Formations upon heat treatment from 300°C to 800°C. The decrease in resistivity can be reasoned by the chemical transformations of organic matter through thermal maturation. The results of solid-state C13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy imaging confirmed increase in graphitization and aromaticity in the kerogen samples as thermal maturity increases. Our outcomes can potentially improve interpretation of electrical resistivity logs in organic-rich mudrocks, such as enhancing well-log-based assessment of in situ hydrocarbon saturation.",10.1190/geo2016-0071.1
On Ratio And Crossover Points In The Interpretation Of Refraction Profile Data,"In this note, mathematical expressions are developed for the coordinates of certain characteristic points which are easy to locate on the refraction segment of the time‐distance graph. The characteristic points are (1) intercept time, (2) critical point at which the reflection time equals the refraction time, and (3) crossover point at which the direct arrival time equals the refraction time. Any two of these are sufficient to determine the depth to a horizontal refractor as discussed by Nettleton (1940), Dobrin (1976), and Telford et al. (1976). Slotnick (1959) discussed the significance of the critical point. Considering the time‐distance relations for the case of two media with speeds V0 and V1 separated by a horizontal discontinuity at depth H, the slope of the time‐distance reflection hyperbola at the critical point is 1/V1. At this point, the emergence angle is equal to the critical angle for velocities V0 and V1. In other words, as one moves away from the shotpoint, the slope of the reflection hyperbola increases from zero to 1/V0 and passes through the value 1/V1 at the critical distance. The important result of Slotnick (1959) about the critical point has been further investigated, and useful relationships have been derived on the basis of it. When the refractor is inclined, the critical point can still be explained but it is difficult to locate. However, a ratio point may be used which lies on the segment obtained by joining intercept time and crossover point. The role of critical and ratio points is discussed in the interpretation of refraction profile data supported by exact mathematical expressions.",10.1190/1.1441928
Dynamic Time Warping — An Improved Method For 4D And Tomography Time Shift Estimation?,"Time shift estimation is a key issue in many areas of seismic exploration such as time-lapse studies and traveltime tomography. Automated estimation is useful because it enables applications such as time strain analysis and automated velocity model building. A commonly used automated estimation algorithm is the windowed crosscorrelation. Unfortunately, this method can be inaccurate in areas where time shifts vary significantly over short intervals. Algorithms based on mismatch minimization have been proposed to remedy this problem. All the mentioned methods suffer from cycle skipping in the face of large time shifts. I, therefore, used the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm as an alternative method to estimate time shifts. I claimed the time shift estimates produced by DTW are of higher quality than those produced by the previous methods, especially with regard to the cycle-skipping problem. I found that DTW always is able to perfectly restore time shifts applied to traces when the changes are purely temporal. I investigated its accuracy when amplitude changes are present, and found that the algorithm is well suited for time-lapse analysis. Finally, we determined that DTW is resilient against cycle-skipping errors, in the presence of large time shifts and with significant changes in the data, and thus a candidate for use in automated velocity model-building methods, such as waveform tomography or full-waveform inversion.",10.1190/geo2013-0239.1
Stop-Go Temperature Logging For Precision Applications,"We describe a new field procedure for stop-go temperature logging of boreholes that attains millikelvin precision. Temperature is recorded continuously throughout the entire log, but the logging probe is held stationary for a fixed time at discrete depth intervals. Equilibrium temperatures at the discrete depths are based on extrapolations of time series using the heat-diffusion theory for an infinitely long cylinder. For a Fenwahl K212E thermistor probe having a time constant of about   7 s  , temperatures are still   6 mK   away from equilibrium after a wait time of   30 s  ; but temperatures extrapolated from the time series are within   2 mK   of equilibrium. A time series over a duration of seven time constants of the probe allows the user to reproduce temperature estimates within millikelvins. The technique was applied at GC-1, a borehole in northwestern Utah.",10.1190/1.2734382
The Effect Of Spatial Variation In Surface Relaxivity On Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Relaxation Rates,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation measurements are sensitive to the physiochemical environment of water in saturated porous media and can provide information about the properties of geologic material. Interpretation of NMR data typically relies on three assumptions: that pores within the geologic material are effectively isolated such that the diffusion of a proton between pores is limited (i.e., there is weak coupling); that relaxation occurs in the fast-diffusion regime; and that surface relaxivity ρ2 is uniform throughout the measured volume. We investigated the effect of spatial variation in ρ2 on the NMR relaxation measurement and evaluated two equations relating ρ2 to the NMR relaxation rate for samples containing two types of surfaces, each with a different surface relaxivity. One equation was valid when there is weak diffusional coupling between pores, the other is valid when there is strong diffusional coupling. We prepared a suite of samples composed of quartz sand and an iron-coated quartz sand. NMR relaxation occurred in two distinct regions: the weak- and strong-coupling regions. In the weak-coupling region, the equation did not accurately represent the relationship between the two ρ2 values and the NMR relaxation rate, suggesting that further research is required to understand the effect of spatially variable ρ2 in this relaxation region. In the strong-coupling region, the equation accurately represented the relationship between the two values of ρ2 and the NMR relaxation rate. The results from these laboratory experiments represented a first step towards accounting for spatial variability in ρ2 in the interpretation of NMR data.",10.1190/geo2011-0462.1
Double-Difference Elastic-Waveform Inversion With Prior Information For Time-Lapse Monitoring,"Quantitative time-lapse seismic monitoring can provide crucial information for enhanced oil recovery, geologic carbon storage, and enhanced geothermal systems. Recently developed double-difference elastic-waveform inversion has the potential to quantitatively monitor reservoirs using seismic reflection data. Because the approximate location of a reservoir or a target monitoring region is usually known, we incorporated this knowledge as prior information into double-difference elastic-waveform inversion. Using numerical examples of synthetic time-lapse models, we found that our new method can quantitatively monitor the changes of elastic properties within reservoirs. Therefore, the double-difference elastic-waveform inversion with prior information on the location of a monitoring region is a promising tool for quantitatively monitoring reservoir properties' changes.",10.1190/geo2012-0527.1
A Tri‐Potential Method Of Resistivity Prospecting,"This paper describes a method whereby three resistances are measured for a four electrode configuration, and relations between these three resistances and their corresponding apparent resistivities are derived. The practical application of the resistance relation as a means of detecting observational and instrumental errors is indicated. The concept of apparent resistivity is examined and by means of examples it is shown that the apparent resistivity can take negative values. Finally, the possibility of using the triple resistivity method as a means of distinguishing between the effects of lateral and vertical resistivity changes on depth probes is discussed.",10.1190/1.1438247
Analytical Expressions For Gravity Anomalies Due To Homogeneous Polyhedral Bodies And Translations Into Magnetic Anomalies,"Complete analytical expressions for the first and second derivatives of the gravitational potential in arbitrary directions due to a homogeneous polyhedral body composed of polygonal facets are developed, by applying the divergence theorem definitively. Not only finite but also infinite rectangular prisms then are treated. The gravity anomalies due to a uniform polygon are similarly described in two dimensions. The magnetic potential due to a uniformly magnetized body is directly derived from the first derivative of the gravitational potential in a given direction. The rule for translating the second derivative of the gravitational potential into the magnetic field component is also described. The necessary procedures for practical computer programming are discussed in detail, in order to avoid singularities and to save computing time.",10.1190/1.1440973
Gravity Measurements In An Airplane Using State‐Of‐The‐Art Navigation And Altimetry,"In 1976 the U. S. Naval Oceanographic Office made experimental gravity measurements over the Atlantic in an airplane using a LaCoste and Romberg shipboard gravity meter, a Honeywell electrostatic gyro inertial system, a Rosemont pressure port altimeter, a Honeywell radar altimeter, Loran C and other electronic navigational aids. Preliminary results were reported at the 47th Annual International SEG Meeting in Calgary, Canada, in 1977. These preliminary results were compared with sea gravity data furnished by the Naval Oceanographic Office and were found to be in general agreement. However, there were some unexplained systematic errors of about 15 mgal and the airplane gravity profiles were considerably more noisy than helicopter gravity profiles reported by William Gumert (1977, personal communication). After the paper was given, we found that corrections for Schuler oscillations in the inertial system significantly reduced the systematic errors. We also found that by making full use of a half‐second sampling rate of the radar altimeter, we could make meaningful vertical acceleration corrections relative to sea level as well as relative to an atmospheric pressure surface. A comparison of the two corrections showed that variations in the isobaric surfaces were the main cause of the noise in the airplane gravity profiles. It also became apparent that the noise could be reduced by flying slower or making successive flights at different speeds.",10.1190/1.1441351
Direct Inversion Of Time‐Domain Electromagnetic Data,"This note describes a simple method for converting transient electromagnetic (EM) sounding data into profiles of conductivity versus depth, based on an approximate image representation for the decaying induced ground currents. The method can provide one‐dimensional (1-D) inversion for any kind of time‐domain EM sounding data; the discussion here is limited to the case of central‐loop sounding. In particular, I apply the inversion to some time‐derivative central‐loop sounding data and demonstrate that essentially the same interpretation of the geoelectric section is obtained with the simple image method as is obtained using traditional iterative least‐squares fitting to layered models. This simple inverse can be computed much more quickly than an iterative least‐squares inverse, making it possible to estimate the geoelectric section concomitant with data acquisition.",10.1190/1.1442256
"Geophysical Case History Of The Horse Creek Field, Laramie County, Wyoming","The Horse Creek field located in Laramie County, Wyoming, was discovered and developed by the General Petroleum Corporation following a reconnaissance gravity survey and preliminary and detail seismic surveys. The gravity survey, made during 1940, delineated a strong maximum gravity anomaly having a magnitude of about 5 mg. Limited seismic work was then conducted in the area during 1941 and 1942 and mapped a prominent anticline having some 2,000 ft of closure. In September, 1942, General Petroleum Corporation spudded in their No. 78-31-G well, located on the apex of the structure. This well was completed as the discovery for the field, producing from the lower Cretaceous‐Lakota sand. The second well, No. 74-6-P, was completed in April, 1943, as the lower Cretaceous‐Muddy sand discovery for the field. Further seismic work was done during 1944 and 1945 to detail and refine the structural picture. Subsequent drilling developed the Muddy sand as the primary producing zone in this field. A total of 32 producing wells has been drilled on this structure and to August, 1958, the total cumulative production from the field was 3,519,000 barrels of oil.",10.1190/1.1438740
The Tube Wave As A Biot Slow Wave,"The tube wave speed in a simple fluid‐filled circular bore reduces to vT=vf/(1+Kf/μ)1/2 as the frequency goes to zero, where vf=(Kf/ρf)1/2 is the acoustic sound speed in the fluid, ρf is the fluid density, Kf is the fluid bulk modulus, and μ is the formation shear modulus. Biot (1952) deduced this simple relation by considering the low‐frequency asymptotic expansion of the exact dispersion relation. In 1956, Biot proposed a theory (Biot, 1956a, b) that predicts a new type of compressional bulk wave in fluid‐saturated porous media. This ""slow wave"" is associated mainly with the motion of pore fluids. It appears that Biot never related this theory to his previous work on the bore problem, although the connection is apparent if the bore is considered as a pore. Typically, the bore radius is about 10 cm, while the relevant acoustic logging frequency is on the order of 1 kHz. With water as the bore fluid, the viscous skin depth is on the order of 100 μm. Therefore, if the bore is to be considered as a pore, the relevant form of Biot's theory is the limit in which the pore radius is large relative to the viscous skin depth of the fluid. This form is the high‐frequency limit, in which the effects of the fluid viscosity are negligible and the slow‐wave dissipation is relatively low.",10.1190/1.1442336
Borehole Seismic Surveys For Fault Delineation In The Dutch North Sea,"A significant share of gas production in the Dutch sector of the southern North Sea Basin comes from Permian Rotliegend fault blocks. Precise knowledge of the positions of these faults is necessary for efficient exploitation of the reservoir structures and for future field development strategies. Two areas are presented where the lateral resolution of the surface seismic data was not sufficient to determine positions of major fault block boundaries accurately. Walkaway borehole seismic profiles were shot over each of these areas with the objective of illuminating the fault boundaries to obtain an image with a higher resolution. The images were generated using borehole seismic reflection‐point mapping and migration techniques. Large‐aperture migrations tend to produce unacceptable migration smiles, while reflection‐point mapping is a model‐dependent process. A hybrid approach to these processes was necessary to avoid problems associated with the limited angular illumination permitted by the field acquisition geometries. Reliable images of the fault boundaries were obtained using migration apertures of less than ±5° relative to the structural dips in the background model and by matching that model with the surface seismic and borehole seismic data. The stability of the process and, therefore, the accuracy of the lateral positioning were verified by testing the migration process using a range of apertures.",10.1190/1.1442744
Simple Expression For The Bubble-Time Period Of Two Clustered Air Guns,"We have developed a simple method of estimating the bubble-time period of clustered air guns from the bubble-time period of a single air gun of the same type and volume. This was done by deriving a characteristic time scale for the normal Rayleigh equation, and then deriving the same scale from a modified Rayleigh system for clusters. Comparing the value for clusters with the value for a single-gun, we then estimate their relative bubble period, which gives a reasonable match (less than 4% relative error in the appropriate domain) to field data.",10.1190/geo2011-0169.1
International Geomagnetic Reference Field Revision 1987,"The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is a series of mathematical models of the main geomagnetic field and its secular variation, the models consisting of sets of spherical harmonic (or Gauss) coefficients. The IGRF has become a widely used means of deriving values of geomagnetic field components in, for example, studies of magnetic anomalies and investigations of charged particle motions in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere.",10.1190/1.1442493
2-D Continuation Operators And Their Applications,"Continuation to zero offset [better known as dip moveout (DMO)] is a standard tool for seismic data processing. In this paper, the concept of DMO is extended by introducing a set of operators: the continuation operators. These operators, which are implemented in integral form with a defined amplitude distribution, perform the mapping between common shot or common offset gathers for a given velocity model. The application of the shot continuation operator for dip‐independent velocity analysis allows a direct implementation in the acquisition domain by exploiting the comparison between real data and data continued in the shot domain. Shot and offset continuation allow the restoration of missing shot or missing offset by using a velocity model provided by common shot velocity analysis or another dip‐independent velocity analysis method.",10.1190/1.1444100
Feasibility Of Co2 Plume Detection Using 4D Seismic: Co2Crc Otway Project Case Study — Part 1: Rock-Physics Modeling,"A key objective of stage 2 of the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies Otway Project is to evaluate the seismic detection limit of greenhouse gas injected into a saline aquifer. For this purpose, injection of a small amount of CO2-rich gas into the Paaratte Formation, a saline aquifer located at a depth of approximately 1.5 km, is planned. Before the injection experiment is undertaken, we assessed the detectability of injected gas with seismic methods in a modeling study. A key objective of this study was to model changes in elastic properties caused by CO2-saturation effects using predictions of reservoir simulations. To this end, we established an elastic property/porosity relation to link the reservoir flow model and the elastic properties of the subsurface. Predicting changes in elastic properties requires suitable velocity-saturation relations. To choose an appropriate velocity-saturation relation, we analyzed the effect of fluid distribution on the time-lapse seismic response by performing 1.5D poroelastic and elastic modeling based on reservoir simulations. The modeling results emphasized the importance of taking the variability of rock properties into account and to carefully estimate dry bulk moduli to adequately represent the sensitivity of rock properties to fluid changes. Furthermore, we determined that the Gassmann-Wood relation was an appropriate velocity-saturation relation at seismic frequencies for the Paaratte Formation. However, changes in acoustic contrasts caused by CO2 saturation between layers below the seismic resolution had to be considered. In this sense, an appropriate velocity-saturation relation also depends on the scale at which we model the seismic response.",10.1190/geo2014-0459.1
Seismic Stratigraphic Exploration Part Ii,"Past seismic stratigraphic exploration capabilities, which found large amounts of oil with crude tools from 1938 to 1962, are illustrated with three additional case histories covering a contribution to the discovery of the only super‐giant reef‐type oil field in the United States, the discovery of a thin sand pinchout reservoir along a strand line, and an exploration method for the delineation of a barrier reef complex and the overlying compaction fold complex. Present and future seismic stratigraphic exploration capabilities will be presented in Part III in the August, 1971 issue of Geophysics.",10.1190/1.1440190
Relations Between Horizontal And Vertical Gradients Of Potential Fields,"Nabighian (1984) and Nelson (1986) have both derived relations between horizontal and vertical gradients of magnetic fields (or any other potential field), whereby a knowledge of one enables one to calculate the other. As pointed out by Nelson, Nabighian's derivation is quite lengthy. In the following, I offer an alternative derivation in the wavenumber domain, which is even shorter than that given by Nelson.",10.1190/1.1442694
Neutron Logging Of Drill Holes: The Neutron‐Neutron Method,"Experiments were performed to determine the distribution of thermal neutrons and of indium resonance neutrons in continuous hydrogenous media and in pipes passing through hydrogenous media. Included in the study were water, brine, mixtures of sand and water, and mixtures of sand and brine. Experiments in a continuous typical barite drilling mud showed that the neutron distributions were essentially the same as in water. Also, from the point of view of these experiments, oil and fresh water are nearly identical. These experiments show that well fluid (and, by inference, cement) imposes serious limitations on the sensitivity and accuracy of the neutron‐neutron logging method. The indium resonance neutron response (or, in general, the intensity of epithermal neutrons) is a more reliable indicator of hydrogen content of the formation than is the thermal neutron response. The neutron‐neutron method of chlorine determination was found to be not sensitive enough to be useful with brines of the concentrations ordinarily found in reservoirs.",10.1190/1.1437712
"Vertical Open Fractures And Shear‐Wave Velocities Derived From Vsps, Full Waveform Acoustic Logs, And Televiewer Data","Fracture or stress‐related shear‐wave birefringence (or azimuthal anisotropy) from vertical seismic profiles (VSPs) is commonly observed today, but no attempt is made to fit the observations with observed in‐situ fractures and velocities. With data from a hard rock (limestones, dolomites, and anhydrites) region of Michigan, fast and slow shear‐wave velocities have been derived from a nine‐component zero offset VSP and compared to shear‐wave velocities from two full waveform acoustic logs. To represent the shear‐wave birefringence that affects the shear wave's vertical propagation, a propagator matrix technique is used allowing a local measurement independent of the overburden layers. The picked times obtained by using a correlation technique have been corrected in the birefringent regions before we compute the fast and slow velocities. Although there are some differences between the three velocity sets, there is a good fit between the velocities from the shear‐wave VSP and those from the two logs. We suspect the formations showing birefringence to be vertically fractured. To support this, we examine the behavior of the Stoneley wave on the full waveform acoustic logs in the formations. In addition, we analyze the borehole televiewer data from a nearby well. There is a good fit between the fractures seen from the VSP data and those seen from the borehole.",10.1190/1.1443467
Decomposed Element-Free Galerkin Method Compared With Finite-Difference Method For Elastic Wave Propagation,"The decomposed element-free Galerkin (DEFG) method is a modified scheme to resolve shortcomings of memory use in element-free Galerkin (EFG) methods. DEFG solves elastic wave equation problems by alternately updating the stress-strain relations and the equations of motion as in the staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) method. DEFG requires at most twice the memory space, a size comparable to that used by the FD method. In addition, DEFG can adopt perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary conditions as in the FD case. To confirm that DEFG performs as well as FD, a 2D DEFG under PML boundary conditions was compared with an FD with fourth-order spatial accuracy (FD4) using an exact analytical solution of PS reflection waves. The DEFG results are as accurate as those obtained by FD4. In a comparison using Lamb's problem with eight nodal spaces for the shortest S-wavelength, DEFG provides a remarkably accurate Rayleigh waveform over a distance of at least 50 wavelengths compared with 10 wavelengths for FD4. In the Rayleigh-wave case, DEFG with   1-m   grid spacing is more accurate than FD4 with   0.5-m   grid spacing, and DEFG uses less CPU time. DEFG may be a suitable method for numerical simulations of elastic wavefields, especially where a free surface is considered.",10.1190/1.3111113
Some Technical Aspects Of Reflection Seismic Prospecting In The Sahara,The small signal‐to‐noise ratio encountered in the Sahara required the development of special techniques. The gentle dips and low frequencies permitted the use of a pattern of 100 shot holes recorded by an array of 100 or more geophones per trace with the linear dimensions of the arrays of the order of 100 m. The large structural dimensions allowed the compositing of as many as 5 records into a single trace. Seismic reflection exploration was made economically feasible by the use of pneumatic hammers for drilling and the less expensive nitrates for explosives. The experimental procedures leading to the selection of the techniques are described.,10.1190/1.1438503
Groundwater Nmr In Conductive Water,"A surface method of groundwater prospecting using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in the Earth's magnetic field is under study. The technique is employed for hydrogeological surveys down to a depth of about 100 m. The advantage of this method is that an NMR signal can be observed only in the presence of groundwater. A circular wire loop with a diameter of 100 m is laid out on the ground to excite and receive the NMR signal. An oscillating current with a rectangular pulse‐shape is passed through the loop, with the carrier‐frequency being equal to the proton‐resonance frequency in the Earth's field. The excitation pulse is followed by a nuclear induction emf caused by the free Larmor precession in the Earth's field. Of practical importance is the effect of the electrical conductivity of the ground on a groundwater NMR survey. Finite‐ground conductivity can result in induced currents that can screen the NMR signal. The calculations of NMR signals are based on the transformation of Maxwell's equations in terms of magnetic Hertz potentials through use of the reciprocity principle. Groundwater NMR is measured with an instrument designed at the Institute of Chemical Kinetics and Combustion, Russian Academy of Science, Novosibirsk. Experiments were conducted in the Altay region of Russia. Both NMR‐signal amplitude and phase, were measured and compared with the calculated results for horizontally stratified media. Borehole logs and vertical‐resistivity profiles were also used for evaluation of results. The conductivity is shown to affect both phase and amplitude of the NMR signal at resistivities of a few to a few tens of ohm‐m depending on the depth of the water‐saturated layers. There is good agreement between calculated and experimental data. It is also established that the measurements of only NMR amplitude and phase are not sufficient for determining groundwater salinity.",10.1190/1.1444048
Anomalous Seismic Character—Bering Sea Shelf,"Seismic data collected within basins along the outer Bering Sea Shelf often exhibit a distinct change in seismic character between 1.0 and 2.0 sec two‐way time. This change appears on seismic sections as a reflector or as an increase or decrease in amplitude. The feature is of regional extent. This change in seismic character is a manifestation of what has been called in other basins a bottom simulating reflector (BSR). BSRs are reflectors that (1) are subparallel with sea floor topography, (2) are discordant with stratigraphy where the sea floor dictates, and (3) do not demonstrate all the characteristics of a multiple. Two causes of BSRs are generally accepted. One involves an ice‐like mixture of water and gas, called ""gas hydrate,"" in which gas molecules are trapped within a framework of water molecules. The other cause involves the diagenetic alteration of biogenic opal‐A to opal‐CT in diatomaceous sediments. BSRs were penetrated at three locations in the Bering Sea in water depths greater than 1800 m on leg 19 of the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP). The BSRs at these locations were attributed to the diagenetic alteration of opal‐A. This same diagenesis of opal‐A to opal‐CT is interpreted to be the cause of seismic character changes noted in basins on the Bering Sea Shelf. Pitfalls in seismic interpretation may be encountered where this reflector intersects other reflectors at an observable angle. The BSR may look like a sequence boundary or a direct hydrocarbon indicator. Recognition of the presence of this seismic character change is of two‐fold importance to explorationists: (1) it aids the understanding of the geology of the Bering Sea Shelf, and (2) it helps avoid seismic interpretational pitfalls.",10.1190/1.1441489
Relation Between Firing Current And Performance In Seismograph Caps,"The time break characteristics of both ""SS"" and ""SSS"" seismograph caps are discussed. Particular attention is given to the occurrence, length, and uniformity of the various time breaks over a relatively extensive range of firing currents. At the higher firing currents, the ""SSS"" caps do not show the ""induction period"" characteristic of ""SS"" caps, and at the lower firing currents, the ""total cap lag"" of the ""SSS"" cap is less than that of the ""SS."" Thus the ""bridge break"" and the ""total cap lag"" of this newer product are not only shorter, but they are more uniform than those of the older product (""SS"" caps).",10.1190/1.1437095
Electrical Parameters Of Rocks In Developing Geophysical Techniques,"An electrical rock measurement program has been initiated at the Geological Survey of Canada. Although there has been a considerable amount of work done in the past on electrical properties of rocks, the basic concept of the electrical theory applied to rocks and the definition of electrical parameters seem to differ between each group of scientists. This paper reviews the theory of the parameters that describe the complex electrical characteristics (conductivity, permittivity, and loss tangent) of rocks. A review is made of the measuring systems and classified by technique over the frequency range from 10-2 to 108 hz. For measurements on dry rocks and massive sulfide minerals, a 2‐electrode configuration is used. Measurement accuracy and reproducibility are within ±2 percent. The accuracy is checked against international standard samples. The research aspect of the laboratory is concerned with problems encountered in field surveys. Besides measurements on dry rocks, investigations on ultramafic rocks that exhibit high permittivity and large loss tangent and nonlinear behavior in dry and moist rocks and minerals, have been singled out for study, especially for developing measuring techniques. Experience with these techniques is useful for studying the electrical characteristics of moist rocks, including anisotropic effects, conductive overburden materials, the separation of copper‐rich sulfides from iron‐rich sulfides, and graphite, coal, frozen soils, and ice in permafrost. A better understanding of the complex behavior of electrical currents in rocks and sulfides will lead to improvements in equipment design, techniques, and interpretation in exploration geophysics.",10.1190/1.1440336
An Adaptive Iterative Method For Downward Continuation Of Potential-Field Data From A Horizontal Plane,"We have developed an improved adaptive iterative method based on the nonstationary iterative Tikhonov regularization method for performing a downward continuation of the potential-field data from a horizontal plane. Our method uses the Tikhonov regularization result as initial value and has an incremental geometric choice of the regularization parameter. We compared our method with previous methods (Tikhonov regularization, Landweber iteration, and integral-iteration method). The downward-continuation performance of these methods in spatial and wavenumber domains were compared with the aspects of their iterative schemes, filter functions, and downward-continuation operators. Applications to synthetic gravity and real aeromagnetic data showed that our iterative method yields a better downward continuation of the data than other methods. Our method shows fast computation times and a stable convergence. In addition, the L-curve criterion for choosing the regularization parameter is expressed here in the wavenumber domain and used to speed up computations and to adapt the wavenumber-domain iterative method.",10.1190/geo2012-0404.1
Gravity Terrain Corrections Calculated Using Digital Elevation Models,"Corrections for terrain effects are required for virtually all gravity measurements acquired in mountainous areas, as well as for high‐precision surveys, even in areas of low relief. Terrain corrections are normally divided into two parts, one part being the correction for terrain relatively close to the gravity station (the ""inner‐zone"" correction) and the other part being the correction for more distant, say, 2 km, terrain. The latter correction is normally calculated using a machine procedure that accesses a digital‐terrain data set. The corrections for terrain very close to the gravity station are done manually using Hammer's (1939) procedures or a similar method, are guessed in the field, or simply are neglected. Occasionally, special correction procedures are used for the inner‐zone terrain corrections (e.g., LaFehr et al., 1988); but such instances are uncommon.",10.1190/1.1442762
Quality Of Geophysical Measurements,"The quality of geophysical measurements may be obtained from statistical studies in which the probable error of a single observation is estimated. Since many geophysical functions, when plotted in profile form, resemble smooth mathematical curves upon which ""static"" caused by random errors is superimposed, it is possible to substantially remove the measured function from the errors through the construction of difference tables. Higher orders of differences consist primarily of systematic combinations of individual errors. When a function, u, is observed at equally spaced points, the probable error of a single observation may be obtained from the equation ε≦0.8453(∑K2)1/2⋅∑|Δmu|n where u is the measured function, m is the order of the differences, n is the number of measurements, and the K's are the binomial coefficients of the order, m. Application of the method to seismic and gravity profiles results in probable errors that are consistent with those obtained from the studies of basic data acquired in the field. The method may also be used in many other measurements in the field and laboratory.",10.1190/1.1437740
Model-Based Fluid Factor For Controlled Source Electromagnetic Data,"We have developed a new Bayesian methodology for use of controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) data in prospect risking. The methodology modifies the probability for hydrocarbon presence based on the information in the CSEM data. This is done by identifying the linear combination of the data where the weighted sum provides the optimal separation of cases with and without hydrocarbons. The weighted sum of the CSEM data is a model-based parallel to the well-known fluid factor used in seismic amplitude analysis. The optimal weighting is constructed based on forward modeling of models with and without hydrocarbons. We further compute the statistical distributions of the fluid factor with and without hydrocarbon presence, and use these distributions to compute the value of CSEM data and update the probability for hydrocarbon presence. The method does not involve inversion for the complete resistivity model but computes the chance of hydrocarbon presence directly. The method was tested on data from Troll, where it provided evidence for hydrocarbon presence, and on another data set, where it provided evidence against hydrocarbons. These real case examples showed the importance of rock physical knowledge. Improved control on the rock properties leads to stronger conclusions and higher value of the CSEM data. The proposed model-based approach is fast and robust.",10.1190/geo2010-0300.1
Statistical Multioffset Phase Analysis For Surface-Wave Processing In Laterally Varying Media,"Standard procedures for dispersion analysis of surface waves use multichannel wavefield transforms. By using several receivers, such procedures integrate the information along the entire acquisition array. That approach improves data quality and robustness significantly, but its side effects are spatial averaging and loss of lateral resolution. Recently, a new approach was developed to address that issue and maximize lateral resolution. The new method uses multioffset phase analysis to detect and locate sharp lateral variations in velocity. By using the phase analysis approach, the number of usable channels can be maximized, thereby gaining data quality without compromising lateral resolution. In fact, such preliminary data analysis also allows selection of the appropriate traces on which to perform multichannel processing. Such multioffset phase analysis can be enhanced by f-k filtering, which assures the selection of only one wave-propagation mode, and by a statistical analysis that takes advantage of data redundancy of multishot data, usually collected, for example, in land refraction surveys. Moreover, this novel statistical method with f-k filtering can be used to retrieve a dispersion curve, in principle, for each receiver location. The quasi-continuous pseudoimage of shear-wave velocity as a function of offset and frequency allows a characterization of lateral variations in velocity, whether they are sharp or smooth.",10.1190/1.3542076
Orthorhombic Media: Modeling Elastic Wave Behavior In A Vertically Fractured Earth,"Vertical fractures and horizontal fine layering combine to form a long, wavelength equivalent orthorhombic medium. Such media constitute a subset of the set of all orthorhombic media. Orthorhombic elastic symmetry is the lowest symmetry for which the slowness surface (the solution of the Christoffel equation) is bicubic rather sextic. Various properties of orthorhombic media, such as the number and location of conical points and longitudinal directions, may be derived from the slowness surface or, because of its bicubic character, the squared slowness surface, which is a cubic  surface. From the occurrence and angular orientation of some of these distinctive features, conclusions can be drawn with respect to the properties of the medium and to the parameters of the assumed underlying causes of the anisotropy. The estimation of these more subtle properties gains greater importance with the proliferation of multiazimuthal seismic surveys and the ability to drill along ever more complicated 3‐D well trajectories.",10.1190/1.1444297
Finite‐Difference Modeling Of Faults And Fractures,"For the purposes of seismic propagation, a slip fault may be regarded as a surface across which the displacement caused by a seismic wave is discontinuous while the stress traction remains continuous. The simplest assumption is that this slip and the stress traction are linearly related. Such a linear slip interface condition is easily modeled when the fault is parallel to the finite‐difference grid, but is more difficult to do for arbitrary nonplanar fault surfaces. To handle such situations we introduce equivalent medium theory to model material behavior in the cells of the finite‐ difference grid intersected by the fault. Virtually identical results were obtained from modeling the fault by (1) an explicit slip interface condition (fault parallel to the grid) and (2) using the equivalent medium theory when the finite‐difference grid was rotated relative to the fault and receiver array. No additional computation time is needed except for the preprocessing required to find the relevant cells and their associated moduli. The formulation is sufficiently general to include faults in and between arbitrary anisotropic materials with slip properties that vary as a function of position.",10.1190/1.1443884
Spectral-Decomposition Response To Reservoir Fluids From A Deepwater West Africa Reservoir,"We study the spectral-decomposition response to reservoir fluids from a deepwater West Africa reservoir through a systematic modeling approach. Our workflow starts from selecting the seismic data (far-angle seismic images) that show more pronounced fluid effect based on amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) analysis. Synthetic seismic forward modeling performed at the control well established the quality of the seismic well tie. Reservoir wedge modeling, spectral decomposition of the field and synthetic seismic data, and theoretical analyses were conducted to understand the spectral-decomposition responses. The reservoir fluid type is a main factor controlling the spectral response. For this deepwater reservoir, the amplitude contrast between oil sand and brine sand is higher at low frequencies   (∼15 Hz)  . In addition, synthetic modeling can help identify the possible frequency band where the amplitude contrast between hydrocarbon sand and brine sand is higher. When properly included in a comprehensive direct-hydrocarbon-indicator (DHI)–AVO evaluation, spectral decomposition can enhance the identification of hydrocarbons.",10.1190/1.2978337
3D Laplace-Domain Waveform Inversion Using A Low-Frequency Time-Domain Modeling Algorithm,"We have developed a Laplace-domain full-waveform inversion technique based on a time-domain finite-difference modeling algorithm for efficient 3D inversions. Theoretically, the Laplace-domain Green's function multiplied by a constant can be obtained regardless of the frequency content in the time-domain source wavelet. Therefore, we can use low-frequency sources and large grids for efficient modeling in the time domain. We Laplace-transform time-domain seismograms to the Laplace domain and calculate the residuals in the Laplace domain. Then, we back-propagate the Laplace-domain residuals in the time domain using a predefined time-domain source wavelet with the amplitude of the residuals. The back-propagated wavefields are transformed to the Laplace domain again to update the velocity model. The inversion results are long-wavelength velocity models on large grids similar to those obtained by the original approach based on Laplace-domain modeling. Inversion examples with 2D Gulf of Mexico field data revealed that the method yielded long-wavelength velocity models comparable with the results of the original Laplace-domain inversion methods. A 3D SEG/EAGE salt model example revealed that the 3D Laplace-domain inversion based on time-domain modeling method can be more efficient than the inversion based on Laplace-domain modeling using an iterative linear system solver.",10.1190/geo2013-0332.1
On Plane‐Wave Decomposition: Alias Removal,"The delay‐time (τ‐p) parameterization, which is also known as the plane‐wave decomposition (PWD) of seismic data, has several advantages over the more traditional time‐distance (t‐x) representation (Schultz and Claerbout, 1978). Plane‐wave seismograms in the (τ, p) domain can be used for obtaining subsurface elastic properties (P‐wave and S‐wave velocities and density as functions of depth) from inversion of the observed oblique‐incidence seismic data (e.g., Yagle and Levy, 1985; Carazzone, 1986; Carrion, 1986; Singh et al., 1989). Treitel et al. (1982) performed time migration of plane‐wave seismograms. Diebold and Stoffa (1981) used plane‐wave seismograms to derive a velocity‐depth function. Decomposing seismic data also allows more rapid modeling, since it is faster to compute synthetic seismograms in the (τ, p) than in the (t, x) domain. Unfortunately, the transformation of seismic data from the (t, x) to the (τ, p) domain may produce artifacts, such as those caused by discrete sampling, of the data in space.",10.1190/1.1442595
Recent Developments In Shallow‐Depth Electrical And Electrostatic Prospecting Using Mobile Arrays,"Application of mobile electrical and electrostatic quadripoles during the past ten years has allowed a considerable increase in the size of the surveyed areas, together with keeping a high spatial resolution and a reduction of the total cost of a survey. Two new developments of towed arrays are illustrated here: (1) a pole‐pole array pulled by the operator provides a lightweight solution for mapping large surfaces at a unique given depth of investigation, as shown by the prospection of the Roman‐British city of Wroxeter; and (2) a multipole, multidepth system allows a 3-D investigation of the ground resistivity, as illustrated by the experiments undertaken on the test site of Garchy and on the archaeological site of Montbaron (Indre, France).",10.1190/1.1444450
Geophysical Methods For The Investigation Of Landslides,"Landslides occur extensively in all countries of the world. A landslide is a complex geologic body composed of a combination of layers having contrasting and gradational physical properties. In assessing the danger of landslides, it is of prime importance to investigate the structure of the landslide slope and its water saturation as well as the properties and status of the soils comprising the slope. The investigation and full evaluation of all these problems by traditional methods of engineering geology are sometimes impossible. Electrical and seismic methods are used to obtain the information needed to determine slope stability. Experience has been gained from longterm investigations carried out in various regions of the Soviet Union. Applications include evaluating geologic and hydrologic conditions related to the occurrence of landslides. Primary attention is devoted to the study of landslide slopes proper. The geologic structure of a landslide is considered in modeling it and determining the thickness of both the landslide body and the slip zone. The methods of self‐potential, resistivity, and temperature measurement are analyzed for characterization of the seepage flow through the landslide body. Self‐potential, resistivity, and temperature anomalies are associated with sites of increased landslide activity. Useful engineering properties of soils may be obtained from field and laboratory geophysical measurements. Measurement of changes of geophysical parameters with time are significant in assessing changes in the states of landslide soils. Observation of the direction and velocity of landslide movements is possible with magnetic and electrical methods. Examples of geophysical investigations of landslides in the Crimea, on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus, and in the Volga River Valley are presented.",10.1190/1.1440727
Traveltime Inversion Of Vertical Radar Profiles,"Traveltimes of direct arrivals in vertical radar profiles (VRPs) are tomographically inverted to estimate the earth's electromagnetic (EM) velocity between a surface transmitter and a downhole receiver. We determine the 1D interval velocity model that best fits the first-arrival traveltimes by using a weighted, damped, least-squares inversion scheme. We assess the accuracy of the velocity model using synthetic traveltimes from a known velocity-distribution model simulating an unconfined aquifer. The inverted velocity profile closely matched the velocity profile of the input model in the synthetic examples. Using vertical radar profile data from an unconfined aquifer near Boise, Idaho, we inverted traveltimes to obtain velocity estimates at the well location. The velocity change at a depth of   2.0 m   corresponds well with the measured depth to the water table of   1.95 m  , and at depths between 2 and   18 m  , the velocities ranged between 0.06 and   0.1 m∕ns  . Our estimates approximately match the velocity distribution determined from neutron-derived porosity logs at depths greater than about   2 m  . An important function of inverse methods is to assess (quantitatively and qualitatively) the uncertainty of inverted velocity estimates. We note that the velocity values in the upper and lower parts of the inverted model are not as well constrained compared to those between the depths of 4 and   13 m  . From the model resolution and model covariance matrices of the real-data inversion, we determine the uncertainty in our velocity model, leading to more reliable interpretations of the subsurface.",10.1190/1.2194527
A Waveform Inversion Technique For Measuring Elastic Wave Attenuation In Cylindrical Bars,"A new technique for measuring elastic wave attenuation in the frequency range of 10–150 kHz consists of measuring low‐frequency waveforms using two cylindrical bars of the same material but of different lengths. The attenuation is obtained through two steps. In the first, the waveform measured within the shorter bar is propagated to the length of the longer bar, and the distortion of the waveform due to the dispersion effect of the cylindrical waveguide is compensated. The second step is the inversion for the attenuation or Q of the bar material by minimizing the difference between the waveform propagated from the shorter bar and the waveform measured within the longer bar. The waveform inversion is performed in the time domain, and the waveforms can be appropriately truncated to avoid multiple reflections due to the finite size of the (shorter) sample, allowing attenuation to be measured at long wavelengths or low frequencies. The frequency range in which this technique operates fills the gap between the resonant bar measurement (∼10 kHz) and ultrasonic measurement (∼100–1000 kHz). By using the technique, attenuation values in a PVC (a highly attenuative) material and in Sierra White granite were measured in the frequency range of 40–140 kHz. The obtained attenuation values for the two materials are found to be reliable and consistent.",10.1190/1.1443299
A Prestack Basis Pursuit Seismic Inversion,"Resolving thin layers and clearly delineating layer boundaries in inverted seismic sections are very important goals for exploration and production. Many seismic inversion methods based on a least-squares optimization approach with Tikhonov-type regularization can lead to unfocused transitions between adjacent layers. A basis pursuit inversion (BPI) algorithm based on the L1 norm optimization method can, however, resolve sharp boundaries between layers. We have formulated a BPI algorithm for amplitude-versus-angle inversion and investigated its potential to improve contrasts between layers. Like the BPI for poststack case, the sparse layer constraint, rather than the sparse spike constraint, is used to construct the model space as a wedge dictionary. All the elements of the dictionary are bed reflectivities, which include solutions consisting of thin beds as well. With this dictionary, we use an L1 norm optimization framework to derive three reflectivities, namely, Rp, Rs, and Rρ. Although BPI does not require a starting model, high-resolution absolute velocities (VP, VS) and density (ρ) can be obtained by incorporating initial models in the BPI derived reflectivities. Tests on synthetic and field data show that the BPI algorithm can indeed detect and enhance layer boundaries by effectively removing the wavelet interference.",10.1190/geo2011-0502.1
Seismic Inversion For Reservoir Properties Combining Statistical Rock Physics And Geostatistics: A Review,"There are various approaches for quantitative estimation of reservoir properties from seismic inversion. A general Bayesian formulation for the inverse problem can be implemented in two different work flows. In the sequential approach, first seismic data are inverted, deterministically or stochastically, into elastic properties; then rock-physics models transform those elastic properties to the reservoir property of interest. The joint or simultaneous work flow accounts for the elastic parameters and the reservoir properties, often in a Bayesian formulation, guaranteeing consistency between the elastic and reservoir properties. Rock physics plays the important role of linking elastic parameters such as impedances and velocities to reservoir properties of interest such as lithologies, porosity, and pore fluids. Geostatistical methods help add constraints of spatial correlation, conditioning to different kinds of data and incorporating subseismic scales of heterogeneities.",10.1190/1.3478209
Geophysical Diffraction Tomography At A Dinosaur Site,"In 1979 two hikers discovered the partially exposed bones from the tail of a dinosaur in the high desert of New Mexico. Excavation in 1985 led to the recognition that the dinosaur, informally named ""Seismosaurus,"" was new to science. It is by far the longest dinosaur on record. Excavations continued in 1986 with the discovery that additional bones leading forward from the middle region of the tail, potentially toward the remainder of the skeleton, remained entombed in the 145 million year old sandstone. The site has been the subject of intensive experimentation to assess the feasibility of geophysical remote sensing in exploration paleontology. The efforts of numerous investigators at the site may serve to change the century‐old methods of hammer and chisel, in part, to those based on more modern technology. One of the methods tested is geophysical diffraction tomography (GDT). Unlike the more common straightray algorithms of geophysical tomography that map subsurface properties by projecting received signal amplitude or time of the first signal arrival back to the source, GDT treats the problem as one of wave propagation by inverting the linearized wave equation to compute the spatial distribution of refractive index. Excavation of the ""Seismosaurus"" skeleton continues. The purpose of our most recent GDT study is to further test the method and to guide paleontologists in their future excavations by locating and identifying the buried skeletal remains. A total of eleven imaged vertical cross‐sections displayed features of sufficient acoustic contrast to be tentatively identified as dinosaur bone. Although the GDT resolution is insufficient to characterize bone shape, bone identification was subjectively accomplished on the basis of size, aspect ratio, and position. Based on this interpretation, it is believed that much of the remaining skeleton exists and is in near articulation.",10.1190/1.1443183
Ray-Direction Velocities In Vti Media,"Two-point ray tracing in anisotropic media requires the group and phase velocities to be calculated along ray directions available at each step of a ray bending algorithm. This computation, usually done iteratively or through velocity tables, becomes exceedingly involved for shear-waves that have multivalued group-velocity surfaces, such as in the presence of triplications on the SV wavefronts in vertically transversely isotropic (VTI) media. The difficulties encountered in computing the SV-wave velocities for a given ray direction can be circumvented by solving a polynomial equation whose real-valued roots provide the phase directions of the P- and either one or three SV-waves propagating along a selected ray; those phase directions then allow the group and phase velocities to be computed in a standard fashion. I construct the polynomial and supply computer codes implementing its solution, the codes that can be used in two-point ray-tracing software to improve its performance.",10.1190/geo2012-0163.1
Signal Penetration In The Cocorp Basin And Range‐Colorado Plateau Survey,"Seismic sections from COCORP's 1982 survey from the eastern Basin and Range to the Colorado Plateau of central Utah exhibit distinct cutoff times after which reflections are rare to nonexistent. In the eastern Basin and Range, this cutoff time is approximately 11 s (33 km), but beneath the central Colorado Plateau it exceeds 15 s (45 km). These depths appear to correspond to the base of the crust (Moho), with the lack of reflections from greater depths indicating mantle homogeneity. In general, absence of deeper reflections may be due either to geologic homogeneity or to lack of signal penetration. COCORP line 3 in the Colorado Plateau‐Basin and Range transition zone shows that variations in penetration are significant. On line 3 few reflections are evident below the structurally complex sedimentary cover, which extends to only 4 s (8 km), and virtually none are identifiable later than 7 s (21 km). Lateral variations in the temporal decay of source‐generated energy, together with estimates of corresponding ambient noise levels, infer that limited signal penetration, rather than geologic homogeneity, causes the lack of subsedimentary reflections within the transition zone. Deep reflections, if any, from beneath the westernmost Colorado Plateau appear to be masked by unusually high local environmental noise. In contrast, continued decay of source‐generated energy at traveltimes significantly greater than Moho arrival times within the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau suggests (though it cannot confirm) that the underlying mantle is seismically transparent. Variations in signal penetration, such as those documented here, severely constrain interpretations of nonreflective zones in deep reflection data and should be a standard estimation in any interpretational procedure.",10.1190/1.1442160
Limited‐View Diffraction Tomography In A Nonuniform Background,"The main problems in geophysical diffraction tomography are (1) complicated media and (2) rather limited acquisition geometries. Existing algorithms solve the limited‐view problem in an iterative manner, but are valid only for line sources and 2-D homogeneous background models. In this paper, we derive an iterative algorithm based on asymptotic wave theory that can compensate for a limited acquisition geometry. The method is valid for a 2-D nonuniform background model and point‐source illumination (i.e., a 2.5-D geometry). Paraxial ray tracing is employed to model the arbitrary background wave response, and the general structure of the algorithm has a strong resemblance to the iterative ART‐algorithm used in straight ray tomography. Our method is shown to be stable in the presence of moderate white noise and gives reasonable results, both geometrically and quantitatively, when applied to synthetic crosshole data involving a nonhomogeneous background model and limited view.",10.1190/1.1443796
Two‐Dimensional Velocity Inversion And Synthetic Seismogram Computation,"A traveltime inversion scheme has been developed to estimate velocity and interface geometries of two‐dimensional media from deep reflection data. The velocity structure is represented by finite elements, and the inversion is formulated as an iterative, constrained, linear least‐squares problem which can be solved by either the singular value truncation method or the Levenberg‐Marquardt method. The damping factor of the Levenberg‐Marquardt method is chosen by the model‐trust region approach. The traveltimes and derivative matrix required to solve the least‐squares problem are computed by ray tracing. To aid seismic interpretation, we also include in the inversion scheme a fast algorithm based on asymptotic ray theory for calculating synthetic seismograms from the derived velocity model. Numerical tests indicate that the inversion scheme is effective, and that the accuracy of inversion results depends upon both noise in the data and the aperture of recording used in data acquisition. Two real examples demonstrate that the new inversion scheme produces velocity models fitting the data better than those estimated by other approaches.",10.1190/1.1442239
Estimation Of Magnetotelluric Transfer Functions From Radio Transmitters,"A new method to estimate magnetotelluric (MT) transfer functions using radio transmitters as the source has been developed using an extended version of Weidelt's C function expansion. The expansion coefficients are found from solving a mixed determined linear inverse problem by a truncated singular‐value decomposition technique with a truncation level determined automatically from the data. Synthetic tests with both noise‐free and noisy data show the new method is accurate and robust with respect to lack of transmitters in certain bands. A test profile with 42 stations from a dump‐site investigation in the Netherlands shows that the estimated transfer functions are remarkably stable and smooth as a function of frequency and distance along the profile. Compared with the standard band‐averaging technique, even the formal error bars are generally smaller and more realistic with the new method because the bias introduced by assuming that transfer functions are constant in a small subband is removed.",10.1190/1.1487051
Simultaneous Optimization Of Multiple Objective Functions For Reservoir Modeling,First presented at the SEG 84th Annual International Meeting.,10.1190/geo2015-0006.1
Accounting For Imperfect Forward Modeling In Geophysical Inverse Problems — Exemplified For Crosshole Tomography,"Inversion of geophysical data relies on knowledge about how to solve the forward problem, that is, computing data from a given set of model parameters. In many applications of inverse problems, the solution to the forward problem is assumed to be known perfectly, without any error. In reality, solving the forward model (forward-modeling process) will almost always be prone to errors, which we referred to as modeling errors. For a specific forward problem, computation of crosshole tomographic first-arrival traveltimes, we evaluated how the modeling error, given several different approximate forward models, can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the measurement uncertainty. We also found that the modeling error is strongly linked to the spatial variability of the assumed velocity field, i.e., the a priori velocity model. We discovered some general tools by which the modeling error can be quantified and cast into a consistent formulation as an additive Gaussian observation error. We tested a method for generating a sample of the modeling error due to using a simple and approximate forward model, as opposed to a more complex and correct forward model. Then, a probabilistic model of the modeling error was inferred in the form of a correlated Gaussian probability distribution. The key to the method was the ability to generate many realizations from a statistical description of the source of the modeling error, which in this case is the a priori model. The methodology was tested for two synthetic ground-penetrating radar crosshole tomographic inverse problems. Ignoring the modeling error can lead to severe artifacts, which erroneously appear to be well resolved in the solution of the inverse problem. Accounting for the modeling error leads to a solution of the inverse problem consistent with the actual model. Further, using an approximate forward modeling may lead to a dramatic decrease in the computational demands for solving inverse problems.",10.1190/geo2013-0215.1
"The Design Of Stable, Sparse Wavefield Extrapolators Using Projections Onto Convex Sets","We present the results of poststack explicit depth migration of the well-known 2D SEG/EAGE salt model zero-offset seismic data using sparse wavefield extrapolators. The extrapolators are designed to be sparse by forcing some of the very small complex-valued coefficients' magnitude values to be zero. The proposed extrapolators design method combines the previously reported modified projections onto convex sets (MPOCS) for designing explicit depth frequency-space (f-x) wavefield extrapolation operators with hard-thresholding of the small extrapolators coefficients' magnitude. The real and imaginary parts of the MPOCS operators, with small magnitudes, are replaced by zeros during the MPOCS algorithm iterations. The migrated result of the SEG/EAGE salt model data, using such sparse designed operators, shows comparable migrated results using the nonsparse version of the MPOCS extrapolation operators as well as the image obtained using the well-known phase-shift plus interpolation (PSPI) migration technique. Overall, the sparse operators result in poststack imaging computational savings (in terms of used flops) of about 28% when compared to poststack imaging of the same data using the nonsparse MPOCS designed operators, and of more than 87.77% saved flops using the PSPI technique.",10.1190/geo2012-0130.1
"Detecting Hydrocarbon Reservoirs From Csem Data In Complex Settings: Application To Deepwater Sabah, Malaysia","Controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) field surveys offer a geophysical method to discriminate between high and low hydrocarbon saturations in a potential reservoir. However, the same geological processes that create the possible hydrocarbon reservoir may also create topography and near-surface variations of resistivity (e.g., shallow gas or hydrates) that can complicate the interpretation of CSEM data. In this paper, we discuss the interpretation of such data over a thrust belt prospect in deepwater Sabah, Malaysia. We show that detailed modeling of the key scenarios can help us understand the contributions of topography, near-surface hydrates, and possible hydrocarbons at reservoir depth. Complexity at the surface and at depth requires a 3D electromagnetic modeling code that can handle realistic ten-million-cell models. This has been achieved by using an iterative solver based on a multigrid preconditioner, finite-difference approach with frequency-dependent grid adaptation.",10.1190/1.2435201
Quantitative Determination Of Uncertainties In Seismic Refraction Prospecting,"We present a model of the propagation of refracted seismic waves in planar (horizontal or dipping) layered structures in which we quantify the errors from various sources. The model, called the (mixed) variance component model, separates the errors originating on the surface from those due to inhomogeneities of subsurface layers. The model starts with the assumption of homogeneous (constant‐velocity) layers, but by taking the principal errors into account, variations from this model (including degree of velocity inhomogeneity, vertical velocity gradients, and gradational interfaces) can be identified. A complete solution to the variance component model by Bayesian methods relies on the Gibbs sampler, a recently well‐developed statistical technique. Using the Gibbs sampler and Monte Carlo methods, we can estimate the posterior distributions of any parameter of interest. Thus, in addition to estimating the various errors, we can obtain the velocity‐versus‐depth curve with its confidence intervals at any relevant point along the line. We analyze data from a crustal‐scale refraction line to illustrate both features of this method. The results indicate that the conventional linear regression model for the first arrivals is inappropriate for this data set. As might be expected, geophone spacing strongly affects our ability to resolve the heterogeneities. Differences in the amount of velocity heterogeneity in different layers can be resolved, and may be useful for lithologic characterization. For this crustal‐scale problem, a velocity profile derived from this method is an improvement over simple linear interpretations, but it could be further refined by more comprehensive methods attempting to match later arrivals and wave amplitudes as well as first arrivals. The method could also be applied to smaller‐scale refraction problems, such as determination of refraction statics, or constraints on the degree of probable lateral variations in velocity of shallow layers, for improved processing of reflection data.",10.1190/1.1443438
Generalization Of Traveltime Inversion,"A nonlinear inversion method is presented, especially suited for the determination of global velocity models. In a certain sense, it can be considered as a generalization of methods based on traveltimes of reflections, with the requirement of accurately having to determine traveltimes replaced by the (less stringent and less subjective) requirement of having to define time windows around main reflections (or composite reflections) of interest. It is based on an error norm, related to the phase of the wavefield, which is directly computed from wavefield measurements. Therefore, the cumbersome step of interpreting arrivals and measuring arrival times is avoided. The method is applied to the reconstruction of a depth‐dependent global velocity model from a set of plane‐wave responses and is compared to other methods. Despite the fact that the new error norm only makes use of data having a temporal bandwidth of a few Hz, its behavior is very similar to the behavior of the error norm used in traveltime inversion.",10.1190/1.1443193
Investigating Peatland Stratigraphy And Hydrogeology Using Integrated Electrical Geophysics,"Hydrology has been suggested as the mechanism controlling vegetation and related surficial pore‐water chemistry in large peatlands. Peatland hydrology influences the carbon dynamics within these large carbon reservoirs and will influence their response to global warming. A geophysical survey was completed in Caribou Bog, a large peatland in Maine, to evaluate peatland stratigraphy and hydrology. Geophysical measurements were integrated with direct measurements of peat stratigraphy from probing, fluid chemistry, and vegetation patterns in the peatland. Consistent with previous field studies, ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) was an excellent method for delineating peatland stratigraphy. Prominent reflectors from the peat‐lake sediment and lake sediment‐mineral soil contacts were precisely recorded up to 8 m deep. Two‐dimensional resistivity and induced polarization imaging were used to investigate stratigraphy beneath the mineral soil, beyond the range of GPR. We observe that the peat is chargeable, and that IP imaging is an alternative method for defining peat thickness. The chargeability of peat is attributed to the high surface‐charge density on partially decomposed organic matter. The electrical conductivity imaging resolved glaciomarine sediment thickness (a confining layer) and its variability across the basin. Comparison of the bulk conductivity images with peatland vegetation revealed a correlation between confining layer thickness and dominant vegetation type, suggesting that stratigraphy exerts a control on hydrogeology and vegetation distribution within this peatland. Terrain conductivity measured with a Geonics EM31 meter correlated with confining glaciomarine sediment thickness and was an effective method for estimating variability in glaciomarine sediment thickness over approximately 18 km2. Our understanding of the hydrogeology, stratigraphy, and controls on vegetation growth in this peatland was much enhanced from the geophysical study.",10.1190/1.1468597
A Modeling Study Of Augmenting Coarse-Grid 3D Controlled-Source Electromagnetics With Data From A Towed Receiver Array,"We have considered the simultaneous 3D inversion of controlled-source electromagnetic data from a towed receiver array and a coarse grid of stationary seabed receivers. Our 3D synthetic model demonstrated the sensitivity and effect on imaging of towed and seabed receiver data. The short-offset data from the towed receivers at 1–3 km offset are effective at resolving a shallow resistor at a 400-m burial depth. On the other hand, the data from the stationary seabed receivers have less noise and will resolve the 3D geometry of resistive structures buried at the 1–2 km depths typical of a hydrocarbon reservoir. We have determined how the complementary sensitivity of data from the two receiver types can be used in simultaneous inversion to recover the shallow and deep resistors.",10.1190/geo2014-0583.1
Computational Methods For Large-Scale 3D Acoustic Finite-Difference Modeling: A Tutorial,"We present a set of methods for modeling wavefields in three dimensions with the acoustic-wave equation. The primary applications of these modeling methods are the study of acquisition design, multiple suppression, and subsalt imaging for surface-streamer and ocean-bottom recording geometries. We show how to model the acoustic wave equation in three dimensions using limited computer memory, typically using a single workstation, leading to run times on the order of a few CPU hours to a CPU day. The structure of the out-of-core method presented is also used to improve the efficiency of in-core modeling, where memory-to-cache-to-memory data flow is essentially the same as the data flow for an out-of-core method. Starting from the elastic-wave equation, we develop a vector-acoustic algorithm capable of efficiently modeling multicomponent data in an acoustic medium. We show that data from this vector-acoustic algorithm can be used to test upgoing/downgoing separation of P-waves recorded by ocean-bottom seismic acquisition.",10.1190/1.2753753
Gravitational Attraction Of A Rectangular Prism With Depth‐Dependent Density,"The gravity effect produced by two and three‐dimensional bodies with nonuniform density contrast has been treated by several authors. One of the first attempts in this direction made by Cordell (1973), who developed a method to compute the gravity effect due to a two‐dimensional prism whose density decreases exponentially with depth. A different approach was proposed by Murthy and Rao (1979). They extended the line‐integral method to obtain the gravity effect for bodies of arbitrary cross‐sections, with density contrast varying linearly with depth. Chai and Hinze (1988) have derived a wavenumber‐domain approach to compute the gravity effect due to a vertical prism whose density contrast varies exponentially with depth. Recently, Rao (1990) has developed a closed expression of the gravity field produced by an asymmetrical trapezoidal body whose density varies with depth following a quadratic polynomial.",10.1190/1.1443261
Apparent Resistivity For Dipping Beds—A Discussion,"Two groups of workers, here designated the ""image school"" and the ""harmonic school"" respectively, have attacked the problem of the interpretation of resistivity data over a dipping bed or dipping fault. The earlier attempts were made by the image school; but the more successful attempts have been made only recently by the harmonic school. The most successful work prior to that presented in the foregoing paper by Maeda has been done by the Russians, whose papers in their English translation are probably available to few American geophysicists. The purpose of this discussion is to appraise the relative merits of various prior solutions to the dipping bed problem in the light of the exact solution to the problem, which is given by Maeda. The terminology and symbols used herein are identical to those used by Maeda in his paper.",10.1190/1.1438110
3D Induced-Polarization Data Inversion For Complex Resistivity,"The conductive and capacitive material properties of the subsurface can be quantified through the frequency-dependent complex resistivity. However, the routine three-dimensional (3D) interpretation of voluminous induced polarization (IP) data sets still poses a challenge due to large computational demands and solution nonuniqueness. We have developed a flexible methodology for 3D (spectral) IP data inversion. Our inversion algorithm is adapted from a frequency-domain electromagnetic (EM) inversion method primarily developed for large-scale hydrocarbon and geothermal energy exploration purposes. The method has proven to be efficient by implementing the nonlinear conjugate gradient method with hierarchical parallelism and by using an optimal finite-difference forward modeling mesh design scheme. The method allows for a large range of survey scales, providing a tool for both exploration and environmental applications. We experimented with an image focusing technique to improve the poor depth resolution of surface data sets with small survey spreads. The algorithm's underlying forward modeling operator properly accounts for EM coupling effects; thus, traditionally used EM coupling correction procedures are not needed. The methodology was applied to both synthetic and field data. We tested the benefit of directly inverting EM coupling contaminated data using a synthetic large-scale exploration data set. Afterward, we further tested the monitoring capability of our method by inverting time-lapse data from an environmental remediation experiment near Rifle, Colorado. Similar trends observed in both our solution and another 2D inversion were in accordance with previous findings about the IP effects due to subsurface microbial activity.",10.1190/1.3560156

Uxo Detection And Identification Based On Intrinsic Target Polarizabilities — A Case History,"Electromagnetic induction data parameterized in time-dependent object intrinsic polarizabilities can discriminate unexploded ordnance (UXO) from false targets (scrap metal). Data from a cart-mounted system designed to discriminate UXO of   20–155 mm   in diameter are used. Discriminating UXO from irregular scrap metal is based on the principal dipole polarizabilities of a target. Nearly intact UXO displays a single major polarizability coincident with the long axis of the object and two equal, smaller transverse polarizabilities, whereas metal scraps have distinct polarizability signatures that rarely mimic those of elongated symmetric bodies. Based on a training data set of known targets, objects were identified by estimating the probability that an object is a single UXO. Our test survey took place on a military base where   4.2-inch   mortar shells and scrap metal were present. We detected and correctly discriminated all   4.2-inch   mortars, and in that process we added 7% and 17%, respectively, of dry holes (digging scrap) to the total number of excavations in two different survey modes. We also demonstrated a mode of operation that might be more cost effective than current practice.",10.1190/1.2997419
The Geophysicist As A Forecaster,"The commercial geophysicist has hitherto been little concerned with a realm of geophysics which deals with the detection of non‐equilibrium by measuring the time‐rate of change of a physical property in a localized area, in order to forecast when a critical point will appear in the system, and what magnitude of transition is probable. The author has selected some examples of such geophysical problems, which he considers of great economic importance, and which would appear amenable to our present technique or to some modification thereof.",10.1190/1.1445050
Three‐Dimensional Seismic Model Studies,"Elastic wave propagation in a two‐layer section has been studied with a solid two‐bed model and records resembling seismograms obtained for the four possible source‐detector configurations. Numerous events are identified. Among these, the shear waves are found to be surprisingly prominent. The amplitude of the ground roll falls off approximately as (distance)-1/2. This is the amplitude‐range dependence expected for a surface wave. The ability of two in‐line detectors to reduce surface waves has been demonstrated.",10.1190/1.1438118
Measuring Velocity Dispersion And Attenuation In The Exploration Seismic Frequency Band,"No perfectly elastic medium exists in the earth. In an anelastic medium, seismic waves are distorted by attenuation and velocity dispersion. Velocity dispersion depends on the petrophysical properties of reservoir rocks, such as porosity, fractures, fluid mobility, and the scale of heterogeneities. However, velocity dispersion usually is neglected in seismic data processing partly because of the insufficiency of observations in the exploration seismic frequency band (∼5 through   200 Hz  ). The feasibility of determining velocity dispersion in this band is investigated. Four methods are used in measuring velocity dispersion from uncorrelated vibrator vertical seismic profile (VSP) data: the moving window crosscorrelation (MWCC) method, instantaneous phase method, time-frequency spectral decomposition method, and cross-spectrum method. The MWCC method is a new method that is satisfactorily robust, accurate, and efficient in measuring the frequency-dependent traveltime in uncorrelated vibrator records. The MWCC method is applied to the uncorrelated vibrator VSP data acquired in the Mallik gas hydrate research well. For the first time, continuous velocity dispersion is observed in the exploration seismic frequency band using uncorrelated vibrator VSP data. The observed velocity dispersion is fitted to a straight line with respect to log frequency to calculate  Q . This provides an alternative method for  Q  measurement.",10.1190/1.3068426
Near‐Surface Vsp Surveys Using The Seismic Cone Penetrometer,"We have found that high‐quality vertical seismic profile (VSP) data can be collected for near‐surface applications using the seismic cone penetrometer. Cone‐mounted accelerometers are used as the VSP receivers, and a sledgehammer against the cone truck baseplate is used as a source. This technique eliminates the need to drill a borehole, thereby reducing the cost of the survey, and results in a less invasive means of obtaining VSP data. Two SH-wave VSP surveys were acquired over a deltaic sand/silt sequence and compared to an SH-wave common‐depth‐point (CDP) reflection profile. The VSP data were processed using a combination of singular‐value‐decomposition filtering, deconvolution, and f-k filtering to produce the final VSP extracted traces. The VSP traces correlate well with cone geotechnical logs and the CDP surface‐seismic data. The first breaks from the VSP can be used to generate shear‐wave velocity profiles that are important for time‐to‐depth conversion and the velocity correction of the CDP surface data.",10.1190/1.1444798
Topography Can Affect Linearization In Tomographic Inversions,"Linearized inverse techniques commonly are used to solve for velocity models from traveltime data. The amount that a model may change without producing large, nonlinear changes in the predicted traveltime data is dependent on the surface topography and parameterization. Simple, one‐layer, laterally homogeneous, constant‐gradient models are used to study analytically and empirically the effect of topography and parameterization on the linearity of the model‐data relationship. If, in a weak‐velocity‐gradient model, rays turn beneath a valley with topography similar to the radius of curvature of the raypaths, then large nonlinearities will result from small model perturbations. Hills, conversely, create environments in which the data are more nearly linearly related to models with the same model perturbations.",10.1190/1.1444280
Hydrophone Vsp Imaging At A Shallow Site,"We evaluated the capabilities of vertical seismic profiling (VSP) for imaging the complex heterogeneous unconsolidated sedimentary structures at a shallow site. We deployed a 24‐level hydrophone array with 0.5-m level spacing down a preexisting poly vinyl chloride (PVC) cased well. Data acquisition time was quick. Only 15 multioffset shot points using a hammer‐on‐plate source were needed to acquire reflection data between the water table at 3 m and the bedrock at 35 m to produce a depth section image. This image extended 9 m from the receiver well, yielding resolutions between fresh‐water‐bearing sands and impermeable muds and clays of better than 1 m. Depth accuracy of the image was confirmed by good correlation with cone penetrometer logs. We used conventional wavefield separation and VSP-CDP mapping techniques to image the data. Tube waves, created by seismic arrivals at cross‐sectional area changes in the borehole fluid column, were the primary source of coherent noise in the data. The tube‐wave arrival structure was complicated by the hydrophone array, which generated and scattered tube waves at each hydrophone pod. To combat the tube wave interference, we inserted closed‐cell‐foam baffles between elements. The baffles attenuated and slowed the tube waves, and reduced generation and scattering. A comparison between unbaffled and baffled VSP data showed that baffling increased the maximum useful frequency from 300 Hz to over 900 Hz. By contrast, surface shot data recorded at the same site, using buried 40-Hz vertical geophones, exhibited useful frequencies of less than 250 Hz. In addition, coherent noise in surface shot records caused by air waves and first arrivals made it very difficult to identify shallow reflections above 25 m. Reflections from depths as shallow as 10 m were easy to identify in the baffled VSP data.",10.1190/1.1444193
Double-Difference Waveform Inversion: Feasibility And Robustness Study With Pressure Data,"Time-lapse seismic data are widely used to monitor reservoir changes. Qualitative comparisons between baseline and monitor data sets or image volumes provide information about fluid and pressure effects within the reservoir during production. However, to perform real quantitative analysis of such reservoir changes, quantitative estimates of the elastic parameters are required as input parameters to rock-physics-based reservoir models. Full-waveform inversion has been proposed as a potential tool for retrieving subsurface properties, such as P- and S-wave velocities and density by fitting simulated waveforms to seismic data. An extension of this method to time-lapse applications seems straightforward, but, in fact, it requires more tailored processes such as double-difference waveform inversion (DDWI). We used realistic 2D synthetic pressure data examples to compare the performance of DDWI with that of two other inversion schemes: one using the same starting model for both inversions and the other starting the monitor inversion with the final baseline inversion model. The data simulation and inversion were based on acoustic theory. Although P-wave velocity changes were reliably recovered by each inversion method, DDWI was found to deliver the best results when perfectly repeated surveys were used. However, differencing the baseline and monitor data sets, as required by DDWI, could be found to be sensitive to the presence of survey nonrepeatability. To investigate the feasibility of using DDWI in practice, the dependence of DDWI on the quality of the baseline models and its robustness to survey nonrepeatability were studied with numerical tests. Various types of nonrepeatability were considered separately in the synthetic tests, including random noise, acquisition geometry mismatch, source wavelet discrepancy, and overburden velocity changes. A study of the correlation between the levels and types of nonrepeatability and the resulting contamination of the inversion results found that, for pressure data, DDWI was capable of inverting reliably for P-wave velocity changes under realistic survey nonrepeatability conditions.",10.1190/geo2014-0489.1

Estimating Frequency-Dependent Attenuation Quality Factor Values From Prestack Surface Seismic Data,"The intrinsic seismic quality factor Q is known from poroelastic rock-physics theory to be frequency dependent, even within typical bandwidths of individual surface- and borehole-based surveys in which measurement methods usually deliver frequency-independent Q. Thus, measuring frequency-dependent Q instead offers better characterization of seismic properties and moreover a potential step toward estimating permeability directly from seismic data. Therefore, we have introduced a method to measure frequency-dependent Q from pairs of reflections in prestack τ-p domain surface seismic data — a data type that, unlike a vertical seismic profile, offers useful areal coverage. Although, in principle, any analytic form with a manageable number of parameters could be prescribed, the frequency dependence of Q is modeled as a power law, Q(f)=afb. Inversion is done with a simple grid search over coefficient (1/a) and exponent b, seeking a minimum L1-norm. We have found, using a numerical experiment and a synthetic data set, that it is robust and also accurate down to a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 0.65. Then, Q is estimated for some 955 250×250  m superbins of a 3D prestack ocean bottom cable data set over the Kinnoull field, central North Sea. All combinations of eight prominent reflections between Top Miocene and Base Cretaceous were treated together to give some 21,000 frequency-dependent and (for comparison) constant-Q results. The median coefficient (1/a) and exponent b were 0.0074 and 0.06, respectively, with sharply peaked distributions (excess kurtosis 10). Outlier, strongly frequency-dependent results, given by |b|0.2, coincide with low-frequency ""shadows"" under amplitude anomalies, adversely affecting the spectra of reflections. The inferred frequency-dependent Q at 32.5 Hz, the center of the available bandwidth, is not statistically different from the frequency-independent Q, 181 with a standard error from the distribution of one, derived from the same data. Hence for this data set, a constant-Q assumption would in fact be adequate. However, our method has the ability to measure stable estimates of Q(f).",10.1190/geo2016-0169.1
"On Seismic Computations, With Applications, I","The problem of depth determinations from data obtained by the method commonly called ""reflection shooting"" is an interesting one and one which, very often, assumes an importance that justifies a good deal of study. It is the purpose of this paper to indicate a method for depth determination in two cases which very closely approximate some situations. It turns out that the discussion leads to a set of charts which are universal in the sense that the charts are based on dimensionless quantities and are therefore applicable to any set of units and for any ""spreads"" desired. Inasmuch as ""average vertical velocities"" are often used in practice, the cases considered in this paper are compared with the results obtained by using the ""average vertical velocities,"" and it is found that for short ""spreads"" the depths obtained by either method check very well.",10.1190/1.1437084
Inference Of Lithologic Distributions In An Alluvial Aquifer Using Airborne Transient Electromagnetic Surveys,"An airborne transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey was completed in the Upper San Pedro Basin in southeastern Arizona to map resistivity distributions within the alluvial aquifer. This investigation evaluated the utility of 1D vertical resistivity models of the TEM data to infer lithologic distributions in an alluvial aquifer. Comparisons of the resistivity values and layers in the 1D resistivity models of airborne TEM data to 1D resistivity models of ground TEM data, borehole resistivity logs, and lithologic descriptions in drill logs indicated that the airborne TEM identified thick conductive fine-grained sediments that result in semiconfined groundwater conditions. One-dimensional models of ground-based TEM surveys and subsurface lithology at three sites were used to determine starting models and constraints to invert airborne TEM data using a constrained Marquardt-styleunderparameterized method. A maximum structural resolution of six layers underlain by a half-space was determined from the resistivity structure of the 1D models of the ground TEM data. The 1D resistivity models of the airborne TEM data compared well with the control data to depths of approximately   100 m   in areas of thick conductive silt and clay and to depths of   200 m   in areas of resistive sand and gravel. Comparison of a 3D interpolation of the 1D resistivity models to drill logs indicated resistive (mean of   65 ohm-m  ) coarse-grained sediments along basin margins and conductive (mean of   8 ohm-m  ) fine-grained sediments at the basin center. Extents of hydrologically significant thick silt and clay were well mapped by the 1D resistivity models of airborne TEM data. Areas of uncertain lithology remain below conductive fine-grained sediments where the 1D resistivity structure is not resolved: in areas where multiple lithologies have similar resistivity values and in areas of high salinity.",10.1190/1.3464325
Gravity Due To A Body With Rotational Symmetry About A Vertical Axis,"Mass distributions encountered in gravity modeling are sometimes approximately symmetrical about a vertical axis. Examples include salt domes and other types of piercement structures, fluid behavior surrounding an injection or pumping well, formation damage and mudcake surrounding a drillhole, natural impact craters, human induced craters and underground explosions, and some volcanic and intrusive structures. Occasionally, gravity surveys are conducted in boreholes or vertical shafts that may or may not coincide with the axis of symmetry. The formulations presented here are useful for the interpretation of such gravity surveys.",10.1190/1.1443414
Finite‐Difference Migration Derived From The Kirchhoff‐Helmholtz Integral,Finite‐difference (FD) migration is one of the most often used standard migration methods in practice. The merit of FD migration is its ability to handle arbitrary laterally and vertically varying macro velocity fields. The well‐known disadvantage is that wave propagation is only performed accurately in a more or less narrow cone around the vertical. This shortcoming originates from the fact that the exact one‐way wave equation can be implemented only approximately in finite‐difference schemes because of economical reasons. The Taylor or continued fraction expansion of the square root operator in the one‐way wave equation must be truncated resulting in an approximate version of the one‐way wave equation valid only for a restricted angle range.,10.1190/1.1444063
High-Precision Potential-Field And Gradient-Component Transformations And Derivative Computations Using Cubic B-Splines,"Potential-field and gradient-component transformations and derivative computations are necessary for many techniques of data enhancement, direct interpretation, and inversion. We advance new unified formulas for fast interpolation, differentiation, and integration and propose flexible high-precision algorithms to perform 3D and 2D potential-field- and gradient component transformations and derivative computations in the space domain using cubic B-splines. The spline-based algorithms are applicable to uniform or nonuniform rectangular grids for the 3D case and to regular or irregular grids for the 2D case. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques require uniform grid spacing. The spline-based horizontal-derivative computations can be done at any point in the computational domain, whereas the FFT methods use only grid points. Comparisons between spline and FFT techniques through two gravity-gradient examples and one magnetic example show that results computed with the spline technique agree better with the exact theoretical data than do results computed with the FFT technique.",10.1190/1.2953291
A Computer Method For Determining Seismic First Arrival Times,"Although the seismic first event is most often defined as the first kick on a trace, it is not commonly appreciated that the visual emergence of the kick is dependent upon the signal‐to‐noise ratio and the amplifier gain. Consistent picking can only be achieved by identifying constant phases on the pulse, such as the inflection points or points of peak amplitude. This computer technique identifies both the first kick and the first inflection point on each trace to determine accurate and consistent first arrival times. This is achieved for each shot by determining the mean difference between the times to the first inflection points and the corresponding first kick points and then subtracting this difference from the times to the first inflection points. The remaining constant errors in the arrival times caused by factors such as inaccurate uphole corrections or delays in the detonator or shot‐firing system are removed using a least‐squares procedure which minimizes the difference in the forward and reverse traveltimes between shotpoints.",10.1190/1.1441291
A Refraction Theory Adaptable To Seismic Weathering Problems,"An exponential relation Vy=C(y+A)1n between depth and velocity of propagation of seismic waves is postulated. The exponent is a number between zero and unity. Expressions for the time‐distance relation, the depth‐distance relation, the average vertical velocity, and the vertical time‐horizontal time relation are derived. Applications of the relations to seismic weathering problems are discussed.",10.1190/1.1443721
A Theoretical Study On Formation Shear Radial Profiling In Well-Bonded Cased Boreholes Using Sonic Dispersion Data Based On A Parameterized Perturbation Model,"Interpretation of sonic data can be challenging in the presence of a steel casing that has a strong influence on elastic waves propagating along a borehole. The cement annulus behind the casing together with drilling-induced near-wellbore alteration causes radial heterogeneity in the propagating medium. It is necessary to study the influence of such heterogeneities on borehole waves and estimate the radial extent of near-wellbore alteration in terms of radial variation of velocities away from the casing. To this end, we based our study on the model of a fluid-filled well-bonded cased borehole surrounded by a cylindrically layered formation. The formation is isotropic and purely elastic, and can be either fast or slow. Borehole monopole and dipole dispersions for this kind of model can be obtained from a root finding mode-search routine. A modified perturbation model based on Hamilton's principle is used to predict changes in borehole dispersions caused by formation heterogeneities. A two-layer formation model as the reference state is introduced, which always provides normal dispersive reference dispersion for calculations of perturbation integrals for fast and slow formations. Radial variations of the formation shear velocity can be expressed in terms of a parametric exponential profile. Consequently, estimation of these parameters in the assumed profile yields the radial variation of the formation shear slowness away from the casing. Numerical results using synthetic examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of this radial profiling methodology.",10.1190/geo2011-0279.1
Numerical Evaluation Of The Transient Acoustic Waveform Due To A Point Source In A Fluid‐Filled Borehole,"A key measurement employed in oil well wireline logging is the acoustic wave traveltime over a specified formation interval, typically 1 ft. In the traditional measurement, only the compressional head wave is monitored, but for some time it has been obvious that there is significant additional information, such as the shear head wave arrival, in the received waveform. We describe two numerical methods for computing the profile and parameter dependence of the transient waveform based on a model of the acoustic logging problem consisting of a point source on the axis of a fluid‐filled cylindrical borehole. The response to this excitation is determined at a distance from the source, generally on the borehole axis. In the first of the two numerical methods, called ""real axis integration"", the complete acoustic waveform is obtained. The second method, called ""branch‐cut integration"", evaluates the first compressional and shear‐pseudo‐Rayleigh arrivals individually with much less computation time than the first method. The validity and accuracy of the two methods are demonstrated by their close agreement within appropriate time windows. It is also shown that the results from the ordinary asymptotic method that exist in the literature predict different behavior. The dependence of the transient arrivals on formation parameters is illustrated by various numerical results in both time and frequency domains.",10.1190/1.1440932
"Estimation Of Density, Magnetization, And Depth To Source: A Nonlinear And Noniterative 3-D Potential‐Field Method","The depth to the top, or bottom, and the density of a 3-D homogeneous source can be estimated from its gravity or magnetic anomalies by using a priori information on the maximum and minimum source depths. For the magnetic case, the magnetization direction is assumed to be constant and known. The source is assumed to be within a layer of known depth to the top h and thickness t. A depth model, satisfying both the data and the a priori information is found, together with its associated density/magnetization contrast. The methodology first derives, from the measured data, a set of apparent densities Φij (or magnetizations), which do not depend on the layer parameters h and t, but only on source thickness. A nonlinear system of equations based on Φij, with source thicknesses as unknowns, is constructed. To simplify the solution, a more practical system of equations is formed. Each equation depends on only one value of thickness. Solving for the thicknesses, taking into account the above a priori information, the source depth to the top (or to the bottom) is determined uniquely. Finally, the depth solutions allow a unit‐density gravity model to be computed, which is compared to the observed gravity to determine the density contrast. A similar procedure can be used for magnetic data. Tests on synthetic anomalies and on real data demonstrate the good performance of this method.",10.1190/1.1444191
3D Velocity-Independent Elliptically Anisotropic Moveout Correction,"Azimuthal anisotropy or lateral velocity variations cause azimuthal variations in moveout velocity, which can degrade seismic images if handled improperly. In cases in which apparent azimuthally anisotropic moveout is present, a single picked velocity is inadequate to flatten an event on a 3D CMP gather. Conventional velocity-analysis techniques require a significant amount of time and effort, especially in areas where apparent anisotropy is observed. We propose a velocity-independent imaging approach to perform an elliptically anisotropic moveout correction in three dimensions. The velocity-independent approach relies on volumetric local traveltime slopes rather than aggregate velocities and therefore provides an azimuthally flexible description of traveltime geometries throughout the gather. We derive theoretical expressions for extracting the moveout slowness matrix and the angle between the symmetry and acquisition axes as volumetric local attributes. A practical inversion scheme to extract the same parameters is also developed. These parameters are used to solve for moveout slowness as a function of azimuth. Tests on a synthetic common-midpoint (CMP) gather show accurate results for the automatic moveout correction and the inversion scheme. A field data example from west Texas illustrates the application of the automatic moveout correction as a residual moveout.",10.1190/1.3184804
Nonstationary Phase Estimation Using Regularized Local Kurtosis Maximization,"Phase mismatches sometimes occur between final processed seismic sections and zero-phase synthetics based on well logs — despite best efforts for controlled-phase acquisition and processing. Statistical estimation of the phase of a seismic wavelet is feasible using kurtosis maximization by constant-phase rotation, even if the phase is nonstationary. We cast the phase-estimation problem into an optimization framework to improve the stability of an earlier method based on a piecewise-stationarity assumption. After estimation, we achieve space-and-time-varying zero-phasing by phase rotation.",10.1190/1.3213533
Model-Based Dispersive Processing Of Borehole Dipole Wave Data Using An Equivalent-Tool Theory,"We have developed a model-based processing technique for borehole dipole S-wave logging data to estimate formation shear slowness from the data. During dipole acoustic logging, the presence of the logging tool can significantly affect the dispersion characteristics of flexural waves. Therefore, modeling the effects of the tool is essential for model-based processing. We have determined that an equivalent-tool theory using only two parameters, tool radius, and modulus, can adequately model the flexural-wave-dispersion characteristics. We used this theory, together with a calibration procedure, to determine the tool parameters to formulate an inversion method for the logging data processing. Our use of the equivalent tool theory played an important role in fitting the theoretical dispersion curve to the actual flexural-wave-dispersion data, enabling fast processing of the field acoustic data. An advantage of this model-based method is its prediction power, which, in the absence of low-frequency dispersion data, allows for predicting formation shear slowness from the low-frequency limit of the model-fitted dispersion curve. We have also developed an application procedure of the method for field-data processing and demonstrated its effectiveness in the dispersion correction using field acoustic data from fast and slow formations.",10.1190/geo2015-0210.1
"Singular Value Decomposition Of The Velocity‐Reflector Depth Tradeoff, Part 2: High‐Resolution Analysis Of A Generic Model","The symmetries of a block circulant matrix significantly reduce the computational expense of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the variable velocity inverse problem for a generic reflection seismology model. As a result, the decomposition does not suffer from edge effects or parameterization artifacts that are associated with small model spaces. Using this approach, we study the eigenvector and eigenvalue characteristics for a generic model of a size as large as is used with a variety of iterative inversion techniques (100 000 parameters). Singular value decomposition of the raypath inverse problem of a discretized generic seismic model having one reflector indicates that the eigenvalue distribution for the inverse problem is nonuniform, with a large concentration near 0 and a gap near 0.4. All but the long horizontal wavelength reflector‐depth variations cannot be uniquely resolved from velocity variations. Lateral velocity variations serve to significantly reduce the ability of seismic data to resolve reflector depth for most of the horizontal wavelength components shorter than twice the cable length. As a result, automatic velocity analysis methods may not be able to resolve reflector variations when the velocity field is allowed to take on an arbitrary structure.",10.1190/1.1443306
Transform-Domain Sparsity Regularization For Inverse Problems In Geosciences,"We have developed a new regularization approach for estimating unknown spatial fields, such as facies distributions or porosity maps. The proposed approach is especially efficient for fields that have a sparse representation when transformed into a complementary function space (e.g., a Fourier space). Sparse transform representations provide an accurate characterization of the original field with a relatively small number of transformed variables. We use a discrete cosine transform (DCT) to obtain sparse representations of fields with distinct geologic features, such as channels or geologic formations in vertical cross section. Low-frequency DCT basis elements provide an effectively reduced subspace in which the sparse solution is searched. The low-dimensional subspace is not fixed, but rather adapts to the data.The DCT coefficients are estimated from spatial observations with a variant of compressed sensing. The estimation procedure minimizes an  l2 -norm measurement misfit term while maintaining DCT coefficient sparsity with an  l1 -norm regularization term. When measurements are noise-dominated, the performance of this procedure might be improved by implementing it in two steps — one that identifies the sparse subset of important transform coefficients and one that adjusts the coefficients to give a best fit to measurements. We have proved the effectiveness of this approach for facies reconstruction from both scattered- point measurements and areal observations, for crosswell traveltime tomography, and for porosity estimation in a typical multiunit oil field. Where we have tested our sparsity regulariza-tion approach, it has performed better than traditional alter-natives.",10.1190/1.3157250
Electric Dipole Over An Anisotropic And Inhomogeneous Earth,"The electromagnetic fields of a low‐frequency horizontal electric dipole placed over a two‐layer earth have been derived. The overburden is considered to be transversely isotropic with respect to the conductivity. The unequal principal axis of the conductivity tensor is normal to the layers. The substratum is taken as isotropic. The vector potentials at the surface of the earth have been evaluated and expressed in such a way that the fields may be easily calculated. We have considered the special cases of a perfectly conducting, a perfectly insulating, and a substratum whose conductivity is very close to the longitudinal conductivity of the overburden. Asymptotic expressions for the fields have also been calculated. All the results are given in terms of known functions, and some numerical results have been included.",10.1190/1.1439881
Acoustic Properties Of Carbonates: Effects Of Rock Texture And Implications For Fluid Substitution,"More than 250 plugs from outcrops and three nearby boreholes in an undisturbed reef of Miocene (Tortonian) age were quantitatively analyzed for texture, mineralogy, and acoustic properties. We measured the P- and S-waves of carbonate rocks under dry (humidified) and brine-saturated conditions at   10 MPa   effective pressure with an ultrasonic pulse transmission technique   (1 MHz)  . The data set was compared with an extensive database of petrophysical measurements of a variety of rock types encountered in carbonate sedimentary sequences. Two major textural groups were distinguished on the basis of trends in plots of compressional-wave velocity versus Poisson's ratio (a specific ratio of P-wave over S-wave velocity). In granular rocks, the framework of depositional grains is the main medium for acoustic-wave propagation; in crystalline rocks, this medium is provided by a framework of interlocking crystals formed during diagenesis. Rock textures are connected to primary depositionalparameters and a diagenetic overprint through the specific effects on Poisson's ratio. Calculating acoustic velocities using Gassmann fluid substitution modeling approximates measured saturated velocities for 55% of the samples (3% error tolerance); however, it shows considerable errors because shear modulus changes with saturation. Introducing brine into the pore space may decrease the shear modulus of the rock by approximately   1.4 GPa   or, alternatively, increase it by approximately   1.4 GPa  . This change in shear modulus is coupled with the texture of the rock. In granular carbonates, the shear modulus decreases; in crystalline and cemented carbonates, it increases with saturation. The results demonstrate the intimate relationship between elastic behavior and the depositional and diagenetic properties of carbonate sedimentary rocks. The results potentially allow the direct extraction of granular and crystalline rock texture from acoustic data alone and may help predict rock types from seismic data and in wells.",10.1190/1.2831935
A Comparison Of Radiated Energy From Diamond-Impregnated Coring And Reverse-Circulation Percussion Drilling Methods In Hard-Rock Environments,"We compared and analyzed hard-rock drilling elastic energy emission between diamond-impregnated coring and reverse-circulation (RC) percussion drilling methods from an experiment at Brukunga, South Australia. The two drilling mechanisms generated very different seismic wavefields. This comparison emphasized their energy radiation differences and signal characteristics. From the field data, by investigating the raw data energy, frequency analysis, and crosscorrelation tests, the seismic records from percussive RC drilling provided a strong indication that the drill-bit energy could be suitable for drill-bit seismic imaging purposes; the energy radiation from the percussive RC bit could also provide high-resolution images with borehole seismic acquisition. In contrast, at comparable drilling conditions the coring drilling using a diamond-impregnated coring bit was quiet, the radiated acoustic energy from this drilling mechanism was difficult to detect by a surface receiver array, and there was no convincing visible drill-bit signal observed in the experiment.",10.1190/geo2014-0344.1
First‐Break Refraction Event Picking And Seismic Data Trace Editing Using Neural Networks,"Interactive seismic processing systems for editing noisy seismic traces and picking first‐break refraction events have been developed using a neural network learning algorithm. We employ a backpropagation neural network (BNN) paradigm modified to improve the convergence rate of the BNN. The BNN is interactively ""trained"" to edit seismic data or pick first breaks by a human processor who judiciously selects and presents to the network examples of trace edits or refraction picks. The network then iteratively adjusts a set of internal weights until it can accurately duplicate the examples provided by the user. After the training session is completed, the BNN system can then process new data sets in a manner that mimics the human processor. Synthetic modeling studies indicate that the BNN uses many of the same subjective criteria that humans employ in editing and picking seismic data sets. Automated trace editing and first‐break picking based on the modified BNN paradigm achieve 90 to 98 percent agreement with manual methods for seismic data of moderate to good quality. Productivity increases over manual editing, and picking techniques range from 60 percent for two‐dimensional (2-D) data sets and up to 800 percent for three‐dimensional (3-D) data sets. Neural network‐based seismic processing can provide consistent and high quality results with substantial improvements in processing efficiency.",10.1190/1.1443352
Preferential Continuation For Potential‐Field Anomaly Enhancement,"A new class of filter transfer function derived from Wiener filter and Green's equivalent layer principles is presented for upward and downward‐continuation enhancement of potential‐field data. The newly developed transfer function is called the preferential continuation operator. In contrast to the conventional continuation operator, the preferential continuation operator possesses a continuation response that acts preferentially upon a specific band of the observed potential field's Fourier amplitude spectrum. The transfer function response approaches the response of an all‐pass filter away from this band. This response characteristic is useful for at least two common potential‐field signal enhancement applications. First, it is possible with preferential upward continuation to attenuate shallow‐source, short‐wavelength, potential‐field signals while minimally attenuating deep‐source, long wavelength signals (as often happens after application of conventional upward continuation) Second, it is possible with preferential downward continuation to enhance deep‐source, long wavelength signals without overamplifying shallow‐source, short‐wavelength signals (as often happens after application of conventional downward continuation) Preferential continuation, used qualitatively for anomaly enhancement, ably overcomes these two limitations of conventional continuation enhancement.",10.1190/1.1443775
Ambiguity In Analysis Of Velocity And Depth,"Velocity analysis methods generally involve an analysis of the traveltime moveout of seismic events. To investigate ambiguities for such methods, we can start with a simple single layer model and investigate the uncertainty in the estimation of velocity and reflector depths. This analysis will show that the velocity‐depth ambiguity is dependent on the offset‐depth ratio and on the accuracy of traveltime picks.",10.1190/1.1443443
Vsp Detection Of Interbed Multiples Using Inside‐Outside Corridor Stacking,"One of the most difficult problems in the exploration of Devonian reefs is the separation of primaries and short period interbed multiples. This is especially true in cases where weak primary reflections from porous reefal carbonates can be easily masked by interbed multiples generated from stronger shale/carbonate reflections above the reef. This problem of primary‐multiple separation is difficult since there are small normal moveout differences between the primary and short‐period multiple reflections, thus stacking might not be as effective at suppressing multiples as one would hope. Also, predictive deconvolution may be ineffective if it is difficult to design an accurate prediction distance for the deconvolution filter. The ineffectiveness of stacking and deconvolution in some cases has caused us to look for other alternatives. A recent paper by Lines (1996) advocates the use of shaping deconvolution and inversion methods that use well log information. Since reliable well log data are not always available, we examine a vertical seismic profiling (VSP) corridor stacking method for multiple identification proposed in Hardage (1983, 154–155) which obviates some of the conventional problems and which does not require well log data. A variation of this concept was applied to long‐period multiple attenuation by Hampson and Mewhort (1983).",10.1190/1.1444265
Mapping Contaminant-Transport Structures In Karst Bedrock With Ground-Penetrating Radar,"Ammonium perchlorate, a risk to human health, was used formerly to manufacture rocket fuel at the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) McGregor, McLennon County, Texas. Perchlorate exists in several groundwater contaminant plumes, whose geometries were suspected to be influenced by transmissive bedrock structures. To identify these possible contaminant-transport pathways, a towed-array ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system was used to acquire 118 line-km of data across   478 hectares   of the property. The shallow geology consists of bedrock limestone overlain by   0 to 3 m   of clay soil. For the   50-MHz   antennas used, the conductive clay limits depth penetration to less than   3 m   and yields a   1.4-m   wavelength, reducing lateral and vertical resolution. Nevertheless, GPR data resolved the top of bedrock in many areas. Linear discontinuities in bedrock were interpreted as weathered fracture zones, and linear areas of signal loss were attributed to deeper clay weathering along fracture zones. GPR-interpreted fractures have orientations corresponding to known lineament and fault trends, appear to control plume geometries, and tend to have higher hydraulic transmissivities. GPR results led to a more complete contaminant-transport model and were used to optimize the positions of monitoring wells needed to define the extent of contamination. This reduced the cost and time required for an environmental investigation at the site. GPR was helpful also in positioning remedial trenches across contaminated structures, resulting in plume containment at the property boundaries.",10.1190/1.3223312
"Scattering, Symmetry, And Bias Analysis Of Source‐Position Estimates In Euler Deconvolution And Its Practical Implications","Despite being widely used, Euler deconvolution has received little attention in its theoretical aspects. We obtain analytical estimators x⁁′0 and z⁁′0 for the horizontal x0 and the vertical z0 source positions, which are the parameters to be estimated when the structural index is assigned a tentative value. By analyzing the estimators' properties, we show two things. (1) Scattering of the alternative solutions associated with different data window positions has two components: data noise and the use of a wrong tentative value for the structural index, (2) The differences x⁁′0-x0 and z⁁′0-z0, as a function of the data window position, exhibit antisymmetric and symmetric behaviors, respectively, about x0 when the magnetization and the geomagnetic field inclinations are 90°, 0°, or 45°. For intermediate inclinations there is a moderate departure from the symmetry properties. This analysis shows that the criterion for determining the structural index as the tentative value producing the smallest solution scattering is theoretically sound but occasionally fails in practice because data noise also contributes to solution scattering. In addition, the lower sensitivity of the averages of estimates of the horizontal position (as compared with the vertical position) occurs because x⁁′0-x0 displays an antisymmetric behavior with respect to the true horizontal position while the estimates of the vertical position display a symmetric behavior with respect to the same point.",10.1190/1.1487062
Limiting Values Of Gravitational And Magnetic Anomalies Due To A Subterranean Structure Bounded By A Single Differential Surface,"Calculations are made of gravitational and magnetic anomalies supposed due to local variations in the form of a single differential surface separating an overlying rock from an underlying one, the effective thickness of the latter being infinite. Both layers are homogeneous in density or magnetic susceptibility and only those magnetic effects are considered which are due to induction in the earth's magnetic field. The maximum possible values of these anomalies and of their first and second horizontal derivatives are calculated under these simplified conditions, and it is pointed out that the numerical readings of these quantities, provided by survey results, may lead to useful estimates of the extreme depth and proportions of the structure responsible.",10.1190/1.1443705
Vsp Traveltime Inversion For Linear Inhomogeneity And Elliptical Anisotropy,"To account for measured vertical seismic profiling (VSP) traveltimes, we study a velocity model described by three parameters. We assume that the velocity increases linearly with depth and is given in terms of parameters a and b, whereas the anisotropy is the result of elliptical velocity dependence and is given in terms of parameter χ. Using this model, we formulate an analytical expression for traveltime between a given source and a given receiver. This traveltime expression contains the three parameters that are present in the velocity model. To obtain the values of a, b, and χ, we use least‐squares fitting of this traveltime expression, with respect to measured traveltimes. This process of obtaining the parameters is exemplified by a study of traveltime data acquired with a two‐offset VSP in the Western Canada Basin. Having obtained a, b, and χ, we perform a statistical analysis, which shows good agreement between the field data and the modeled data. Furthermore, it shows that the elliptical velocity dependence, although small, is statistically significant.",10.1190/1.1707055
"Shallow Resistivity Survey At South Elton, Louisiana","A direct current resistivity survey covering about one and one‐half townships adjacent to the South Elton oil field is described. The contour map based on data taken 100′ from a current electrode shows many near surface anomalies while that based on data taken 1000′ from a current electrode is comparatively uniform. Conclusions reached were: First, that Eltran and direct current data show good qualitative agreement; second, that the large observed variations in near surface resistivity can hardly be attributed to mineralization emanating upward over structure; and third, that the number of anomalies found is so great that their direct association with deep structure is highly improbable.",10.1190/1.1440503
The Domain Of Applicability Of Acoustic Full-Waveform Inversion For Marine Seismic Data,"Marine reflection seismic data inversion is a compute-intensive process, especially in three dimensions. Approximations often are made to limit the number of physical parameters we invert for, or to speed up the forward modeling. Because the data often are dominated by unconverted P-waves, one popular approximation is to consider the earth as purely acoustic, i.e., no shear modulus. The material density sometimes is taken as a constant. Nonlinear waveform seismic inversion consists of iteratively minimizing the misfit between the amplitudes of the measured and the modeled data. Approximations, such as assuming an acoustic medium, lead to incorrect modeling of the amplitudes of the seismic waves, especially with respect to amplitude variation with offset (AVO), and therefore have a direct impact on the inversion results. For evaluation purposes, we have performed a series of inversions with different approximations and different constraints whereby the synthetic data set to recover is computed for a 1D elastic medium. A series of numerical experiments, although simple, help to define the applicability domain of the acoustic assumption. Acoustic full-wave inversion is applicable only when the S-wave velocity and the density fields are smooth enough to reduce the AVO effect, or when the near-offset seismograms are inverted with a good starting model. However, in many realistic cases, acoustic approximation penalizes the full-wave inversion of marine reflection seismic data in retrieving the acoustic parameters.",10.1190/1.3250269
Seismic Traveltime Analysis For Azimuthally Anisotropic Media: Theory And Experiment,"Natural fractures in reservoirs, and in the caprock overlying the reservoir, play an important role in determining fluid flow during production. The density and orientation of sets of fractures is therefore of great interest. Rocks possessing an anisotropic fabric and a preferred orientation of fractures display both polar and azimuthal anisotropy. Sedimentary rocks containing several sets of vertical fractures may be approximated as having monoclinic symmetry with symmetry plane parallel to the layers if, in the absence of fractures, the rock is transversely isotropic with symmetry axis perpendicular to the bedding plane. A nonhyperbolic traveltime equation, which can be used in the presence of azimuthally anisotropic layered media, can be obtained from an expansion of the inverse‐squared ray velocity in spherical harmonics. For a single set of aligned fractures, application of this equation to traveltime data acquired at a sufficient number of azimuths allows the strike of the fractures to be estimated. Analysis of the traveltimes measured in a physical model simulation of a reverse vertical seismic profile in an azimuthally anisotropic medium shows the medium to be orthorhombic with principal axes in agreement with those given by an independent shear‐wave experiment. In contrast to previous work, no knowledge of the orientation of the symmetry planes is required. The method is therefore applicable to P‐wave data collected at multiple azimuths using multiple offset vertical seismic profiling (VSP) techniques.",10.1190/1.1444259
Automated Detection Of Planar Geologic Features In Borehole Images,"The interpretation of borehole images begins with the detection and classification of features—a time-consuming manual process subject to variations between interpreters. In seeking to automate the detection part for the most frequently picked features (which in circumferential images from clastic rock environments are sinusoids corresponding to planar or subplanar bedding surfaces and fractures), it is not necessary to pick all instances, but it is necessary to pick sufficient representative instances to satisfy the interpretation objective, accounting for a broad range of apparent dips, and allowing for the likelihood of fractures crossing bedding surfaces. A key challenge in this context is the minimization of false picks, as manual corrections would potentially negate the principal benefit of automation. A fast nonsubjective method is described for the detection of prominent discontinuities and the calculation of associated dip angles. It combines a gradient based approach for edge detection with a phase congruency method for validation, followed by a robust sinusoid detection technique. It has been evaluated on microresistivity images from wireline and logging-while-drilling tools, these images having a wide range of features with varying degrees of geologic complexity; the proportion of false positives in the case of noisy data is less than 5%, improving to better than 2% in the case of good-quality data. In contrast to manual picking, the method is fast and gives reproducible results. With potentially thousands of sinusoids in a single image, the method dramatically improves efficiency.",10.1190/geo2013-0189.1
Amplitude‐Variation‐With‐Angle Behavior Of Self‐Similar Interfaces,"Amplitude‐variation‐with‐angle (AVA) analysis is generally based on the assumption that the medium parameters behave as step functions of the depth coordinate z, at least in a finite region around the interface. However, outliers observed in well logs often behave quite differently from step functions. In this paper, outliers in the acoustic propagation velocity are parameterized by functions of the form c(z)=c1|z/z1|α. The wavelet transform of this function reveals properties similar to those of several outliers in real well logs. Moreover, this function is self‐similar, according to c(βz)=βαc(z), for β  0. Analytical expressions are derived for the acoustic normal incidence reflection and transmission coefficients for this type of velocity function. For oblique incidence, no explicit solutions are available. However, by exploiting the self‐similarity property of the velocity function, it turns out that the acoustic angle‐dependent and frequency‐dependent reflection and transmission coefficients are self‐similar as well. To be more specific, these coefficients appear to be constant along curves described by p1-αω-α=constant, where p is the raypath parameter and ω the angular frequency. The singularity exponent α that is reflected in these curves may prove to be a useful indicator in seismic characterization.",10.1190/1.1444699
Migration Velocity Analysis For Ti Media In The Presence Of Quadratic Lateral Velocity Variation,"One of the most serious problems in anisotropic velocity analysis is the trade-off between anisotropy and lateral heterogeneity, especially if velocity varies on a scale smaller than the maximum offset. We have developed a P-wave MVA (migration velocity analysis) algorithm for transversely isotropic (TI) models that include layers with small-scale lateral heterogeneity. Each layer is described by constant Thomsen parameters ε and δ and the symmetry-direction velocity V0 that varies as a quadratic function of the distance along the layer boundaries. For tilted TI media (TTI), the symmetry axis is taken orthogonal to the reflectors. We analyzed the influence of lateral heterogeneity on image gathers obtained after prestack depth migration and found that quadratic lateral velocity variation in the overburden can significantly distort the moveout of the target reflection. Consequently, medium parameters beneath the heterogeneous layer(s) are estimated with substantial error, even when borehole information (e.g., check shots or sonic logs) is available. Because residual moveout in the image gathers is highly sensitive to lateral heterogeneity in the overburden, our algorithm simultaneously inverts for the interval parameters of all layers. Synthetic tests for models with a gently dipping overburden demonstrate that if the vertical profile of the symmetry-direction velocity V0 is known at one location, the algorithm can reconstruct the other relevant parameters of TI models. The proposed approach helps increase the robustness of anisotropic velocity model-building and enhance image quality in the presence of small-scale lateral heterogeneity in the overburden.",10.1190/geo2012-0032.1
"Multiple-Domain, Simultaneous Joint Inversion Of Geophysical Data With Application To Subsalt Imaging","We describe an effective method for joining the benefits of inversion of different kinds of measurements. We show the simultaneous joint inversion objective function, which allows users to link different inversion domains, like seismic with gravity or seismic with magnetotellurics. This function can be extended to any number of domains and does not require that they be sampled on the same grid. Our parallel implementation allowed us to scale well with large volumes of data and a large number of unknowns, and it has already been included in production workflows. Furthermore, it is generic and constitutes a framework where new inversion techniques can be easily plugged in. We also present two different ways of linking various inversion domains for establishing relationships between different model domains and how they can be chosen and used to achieve the best result. Applications of the algorithm using synthetic and field data produce model features generally not achievable with single-domain inversions. Specifically, we applied our technique to real data from the Walker Ridge area in the Gulf of Mexico, and we used the results to reinterpret and remigrate seismic data. The final migrated section clearly found improved quality with respect to previous efforts. Our results document the fundamental importance of integrating nonseismic methods with seismic techniques to increase the image quality of geologically complex areas.",10.1190/1.3554652
Induced Polarization And Surface Electrochemistry,"Induced-polarization (IP) responses arising from activation overvoltage are investigated, with the goal of relating established electrochemical properties and processes to IP time constants. In activation overvoltage, an electrical double layer with a well-defined areal capacitance forms at the mineral-electrolyte interface. This study shows that the known capacitance of the interface is compatible with observed initial time constants for the decay of electrode polarization. Furthermore, because the electrical double-layer capacitance is determined largely by the electrolyte and not the mineral, the conclusion is that, although the polarization is caused by the presence of the mineral, the time constants of the decay are determined primarily by the electrolyte and not the mineral. The dependence of the capacitance on the sign and magnitude of the potential implies that the effective decay time constant will be small at the start of depolarization and will progress to larger values as the decay proceeds.",10.1190/1.2732554
Crosswell Seismic Reflection/Diffraction Tomography: A Reservoir Characterization Application,"A crosswell seismic experiment at the San Emidio oil field in Bakersfield, California, is carried out to evaluate crosswell reflection/diffraction tomography and image the interwell region to locate a possible pinchout zone. In this experiment, the two wells used are 2500 ft (762 m) apart, and the zone to be imaged is 11 000 ft (3350 m) to 13 000 ft (3960 m) deep. With the considered distances, this experiment forms the first large scale reservoir characterization application of crosswell reflection/diffraction tomography. A subset of the intended data, formed of two common receiver gathers and one common shot gather, was collected at the San Emidio oil field. The crosswell data display a wide variety of wave modes including tube waves, singly and multiply reflected/diffracted waves, and refracted waves. The data are processed using frequency filters, median filters, and spatial muting filters to enhance the reflected/diffracted energy. A 2-D layered velocity model with gradients is built using zero‐offset VSPs and full‐waveform acoustic logs from the two wells. This model is used to generate synthetic finite‐difference data for the field data acquisition geometry. The synthetic data are processed and imaged using the elastic ray‐Born 𝓁2-migration/inversion (ERBMI) method. A smooth 2-D velocity model incorporating only gradients and a few layers is used as a background model for the imaging. Considering the limited data acquisition geometry, synthetic data images compare favorably with the initial velocity model. With the encouraging results obtained from synthetic data, the ERBMI method, with the smooth background velocity model is used next to image the processed field data. Images obtained from the crosswell data show a good match with the reflected field in the zero‐offset VSPs and with migrated surface seismic data. From the interpretation of these images, the potential of this crosswell seismic method for answering questions regarding reservoir continuity and existence of pinchout zones can be seen.",10.1190/1.1443597
Elastic Constants Of Transversely Isotropic Media From Constrained Aperture Traveltimes,"The elastic constants that control P‐ and SV‐wave propagation in a transversely isotropic media can be estimated by using P‐ and SV‐wave traveltimes from either crosswell or VSP geometries. The procedure consists of two steps. First, elliptical velocity models are used to fit the traveltimes near one axis. The result is four elliptical parameters that represent direct and normal moveout velocities near the chosen axis for P‐ and SV‐waves. Second, the elliptical parameters are used to solve a system of four equations and four unknown elastic constants. The system of equations is solved analytically, yielding simple expressions for the elastic constants as a function of direct‐ and normal‐moveout velocities. For SH‐waves, the estimation of the corresponding elastic constants is easier because the phase velocity is already elliptical. The procedure, introduced for homogeneous media, is generalized to heterogeneous media by using tomographic techniques.",10.1190/1.1443625
A Special Circumstance Of Airborne Induced‐Polarization Measurements,"Airborne induced‐polarization (IP) measurements can be obtained with standard time‐domain airborne electromagnetic (EM) equipment, but only in the limited circumstances when the ground is sufficiently resistive that the normal EM response is small and when the polarizability of the ground is sufficiently large that the IP response can dominate the EM response. Further, the dispersion in conductivity must be within the bandwidth of the EM system. One example of what is hypothesized to be IP effects are the negative transients observed on a GEOTEM® survey in the high arctic of Canada. The dispersion in conductivity required to explain the data is very large, but is not inconsistent with some laboratory measurements. Whether the dispersion is caused by an electrolytic or dielectric polarization is not clear from the limited ground follow‐up, but in either case the polarization can be considered to be induced by eddy currents associated with the EM response of the ground. If IP effects are the cause of the negative transients in the GEOTEM data, then the data can be used to estimate the polarizabilities in the area.",10.1190/1.1443957
A Stable Free‐Surface Boundary Condition For Two‐Dimensional Elastic Finite‐Difference Wave Simulation,"Two of the persistent problems in finite‐difference solutions of the elastic wave equation are the limited stability range of the free‐surface boundary condition and the boundary condition's treatment of lateral variations in velocity and density. The centered‐difference approximation presented by Alterman and Karal (1968), for example, remains stable only for β/α greater than 0.30, where β and α are the shear (S) and compressional (P) wave velocities. The one‐sided approximation (Alterman and Rotenberg, 1969) and composed approximation (Ilan et al., 1975) have similar restrictions. The revised‐composed approximation of Ilan and Loewenthal (1976) overcomes this restriction, but cannot handle laterally varying media properly.",10.1190/1.1442078
Three‐Component Sonde Orientation In A Deviated Well,"In well seismics, when operating with a three‐component tool, particle velocities are measured in the sonde coordinate system but are often needed in other systems (e.g., source‐bound or geographic). When the well is vertical, a change from the three orthogonal components of the sonde to another orthogonal coordinate system can be performed through one rotation around the vertical axis and, if necessary, another one around a horizontal axis (Hardage, 1983). If the well is deviated, the change of coordinate system remains easy in the case when the source is located at the vertical of the sonde, or in the case when the source stands in the vertical plane defined by the local well axis. In the general case (offset VSPs or walkaways) or when looking for unknown sources (such as microseismic emissions induced by hydraulic fracturing), coordinate rotation may still be performed, provided that we first get back to a situation in which one of the axes is vertical.",10.1190/1.1442786
Global Optimization To Maximize Stack Energy,"We have developed a new method for global optimization, designed to maximize stack energy. Our method includes upper bounds for the stack energy and maximization of the stack energy for each common midpoint. The method quickly identifies ranges of parameter values where the maximum cannot be located. We have used the approach to reach an excellent solution for a difficult sample problem that was created by adding static disruptions to field data. Our new method should apply in many areas of geophysics.",10.1190/1.1444911
Analytical Solution Of The Borehole Resistivity Casing Problem,"There has been a strong interest in understanding how direct current flow is influenced by the presence of a metal casing in boreholes. In particular, when the current electrode is within the cylindrical borehole, the resulting potential in the external region is severely shielded. Nevertheless, it is possible to exploit the external potential, even though it is very weak. Basic investigations have been carried out by Kaufman (1990), and Kaufman and Wightman (1993) employing simplified analytical procedures and by Schenkel and Morrison (1990) using more complicated numerical schemes.",10.1190/1.1443858
"Developments In Exploration Geophysics, 1975–1980","Advances in exploration geophysics have continued apace during the last six years. We have entered a new era of exploration maturity which will be characterized by the extension of our technologies to their ultimate limits of precision. In gravity and magnetics, new inertial navigation systems permit the very rapid helicopter‐supported land acquisition of precise surface gravity data which is cost‐effective in regions of severe topography. Considerable effort is being expended to obtain airborne gravity data via helicopter which is of exploration quality. Significant progress has also been made in processing and interpreting potential field data. The goal of deriving the maximum amount of accurate subsurface information from seismic data has led to much more densely sampled and precise 2- and 3-D land data acquisition techniques. Land surveying accuracy has been greatly improved. The number of individually recorded detector channels has been increased dramatically (up to 1024) in order to approximate much more accurately a point‐source, point‐detector system. Much more powerful compressional‐wave vibrators can now maintain full force while sweeping up or down from 5 Hz to over 200 Hz. In marine surveying, new streamer cables and shipboard instrumentation permit the recording and limited processing of 96 to 480 channels. Improvements have also been made in marine sources and arrays. The most important developments in seismic data processing—wave‐equation based imaging and inversion methods—may be the forerunners of a totally new processing methodology. Wave‐equation methods have been formulated for migration before and after stack, multiples suppression, datum and replacement statics, velocity estimation, and seismic inversion. Inversion techniques which provide detailed acoustic‐impedance or velocity estimates have found widespread commercial application. Wavelet processing has greatly expanded our stratigraphic analysis capabilities. Much more sophisticated 1-, 2-, and 3-D modeling techniques are being used effectively to guide data acquisition and processing, as direct interpretation aids, and to teach basic interpretation concepts. Some systems can now handle vertical and lateral velocity changes, inelastic attenuation, curved reflection horizons, transitional boundaries, time‐variant waveforms, ghosting, multiples, and array‐response effects. Improved seismic display formats and the extensive use of color have been valuable in data processing, modeling, and interpretation. Stratigraphic interpretation has evolved into three major categories: (1) macrostratigraphy, where regional and basinal depositional patterns are analyzed to describe the broad geologic depositional environment; (2) qualitative stratigraphy, where specific rock units and their properties are analyzed qualitatively to delineate lithology, porosity, structural setting, and areal extent and shape; and (3) quantitative stratigraphy, where anomalies are mapped at a specific facies level to define net porosity‐feet distribution, gas‐fluid contacts, and probable pore fill. In essence, what began as direct hydrocarbon‐indicator technology applicable primarily to Upper Tertiary clastics has now matured to utility in virtually every geologic province. Considerable effort has been expended on the direct generation and recording of shear waves in an attempt to obtain more information about stratigraphy, porosity, and oil and gas saturation. Seismic service companies now offer shear‐wave prospecting using vibrator, horizontal‐impact, or explosive sources. Well logging has seen the acceleration of computerization. Wellsite tape recorders and minicomputers with relatively simple interpretation algorithms are routinely available. More sophisticated computerized interpretation methods are offered as a service at data processing centers.",10.1190/1.1441249
One-Way/One-Return Boundary-Element Method And Salt Internal Multiples,"Surface-related multiples or internal multiples can produce artifacts in migrated images using one-way wave-equation methods. Salt-body-related internal-multiple removal remains a challenging problem for this approach. To investigate the effects of salt-body-related internal multiples on subsalt imaging, the boundary-element method is implemented in a one-way/one-return scheme to separate the primary transmission/reflection arrivals at the salt boundaries from the internal multiples. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for modeling primary transmission/reflection arrivals through/from irregular interfaces between strong-velocity-contrast media. Internal multiples are obtained through straight subtraction of primary reflection arrivals from full reflected-wave data. The image from prestack depth migration of these pure internal multiples using one-way propagators is compatible with some strong artifacts in the subsalt region from migration of full-wave data using the same one-way propagators. Results suggest that a significant part of artifacts in the subsalt region in the prestack image for the 2D SEG-EAGE salt model using one-way propagators might be caused by salt internal multiples.",10.1190/1.3374463
"Cocorp: Southern Appalachian Area, Part Ii","The Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) announces the availability of the data package and tapes for the Southern Appalachian area, part II, for the cost of reproduction. These data were obtained by COCORP whose operation is part of the U.S. Geodynamics Project sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and funded by the National Science Foundation. The executive committee of the consortium consists of members from Cornell University, University of Houston, Princeton University, the University of Texas at Austin, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Cornell University is the operating institution.",10.1190/1.1441234
A Towed Marine Gravity Meter For Near‐Bottom Surveys,"Gravity is measured presently on the sea surface and on the sea floor. Surface gravity suffers from loss of resolution over the deep ocean because the perturbing source masses are far from the observer. Bottom measurements recover this resolution, but suffer from poor coverage because of the time needed for each measurement. We have constructed a gravimetry system that combines the rapid data collection capability of a moving platform with the high resolution gained by locating the observations near the bottom. This gravity sensor is tethered to a ship and towed just above the sea floor. The instrument consists of a LaCoste and Romberg shipboard gravity meter modified to fit inside a pressure case that is mounted on a platform designed for towing stability. We have tested it in a survey in the San Diego Trough, a 1000-m—deep sedimented valley in the Pacific Ocean in the California continental borderlands. Multiple gravity tracklines collected there at a depth of 935 m show a resolution of a few tenths of a mGal. The new instrument will be useful for surveys of features whose lateral extent is equal to or less than the ocean depth.",10.1190/1.1444243
A Modified Delay-Time Method For Statics Estimation With The Virtual Refraction,"Topography and near-surface heterogeneities lead to traveltime perturbations in surface land-seismic experiments. Usually, these perturbations are estimated and removed prior to further processing of the data. A common technique to estimate these perturbations is the delay-time method. We have developed the ""modified delay-time method,"" wherein we isolate the arrival times of the virtual refraction and estimate receiver-side delay times. The virtual refraction is a spurious arrival found in wavefields estimated by seismic interferometry. The new method removes the source term from the delay-time equation, is more robust in the presence of noise, and extends the lateral aperture compared to the conventional delay-time method. We tested this in an elastic 2D numerical example, where we estimated the receiver delay-times above a horizontal refractor. Taking advantage of reciprocity of the wave equation and rearranging the common shot gathers into common receiver gathers, isolated source delay times could also be obtained.",10.1190/geo2012-0111.1
The Significance Of Diffraction In The Investigation Of Faults,"Seismic reflection records taken across faults frequently show an overlapping of reflections from the displaced blocks. It is demonstrated that diffraction of seismic waves is a cause and the effect may be used in interpretation. Overlapping is increased if a seismic profile crosses a fault at an acute angle. Plotted dips will be inaccurate unless diffraction is taken into account. Further, the diffraction oscillation pattern will also be obtained if a reflection horizon terminates for a reason other than faulting, for example, at a wedgeout or reef edge, or at a sudden change of facies. The facts developed are demonstrated by practical examples in which attention is directed to the approximations involved in plotting the boundaries of discontinuities.",10.1190/1.1437815
Q-Compensated Reverse-Time Migration,"Reduced amplitude and distorted dispersion of seismic waves caused by attenuation, especially strong attenuation, always degrades the resolution of migrated images. To improve image resolution, we evaluated a methodology of compensating for attenuation (∼1/Q) effects in reverse-time migration (Q-RTM). The Q-RTM approach worked by mitigating the amplitude attenuation and phase dispersion effects in source and receiver wavefields. Source and receiver wavefields were extrapolated using a previously published time-domain viscoacoustic wave equation that offered separated amplitude attenuation and phase dispersion operators. In our Q-RTM implementation, therefore, attenuation- and dispersion-compensated operators were constructed by reversing the sign of attenuation operator and leaving the sign of dispersion operator unchanged, respectively. Further, we designed a low-pass filter for attenuation and dispersion operators to stabilize the compensating procedure. Finally, we tested the Q-RTM approach on a simple layer model and the more realistic BP gas chimney model. Numerical results demonstrated that the Q-RTM approach produced higher resolution images with improved amplitude and phase compared to the noncompensated RTM, particularly beneath high-attenuation zones.",10.1190/geo2013-0344.1
Identifying Patchy Saturation From Well Logs,"Gassmann's (1951) equations relate the elastic bulk (Ksat) and shear (Gsat) moduli of a fully saturated rock to the elastic bulk and shear moduli of the dry‐rock frame (Kdry and Gdry, respectively), porosity ϕ, and the bulk moduli of the mineral phase (Ks) and pore fluid (Kf).",10.1190/1.1444681
Simulated Annealing For Controlled-Source Audio-Frequency Magnetotelluric Data Inversion,"Simulated annealing (SA) is used to invert 1D controlled source audio-frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT) data. In the annealing process, the system energy is taken as the root-mean-square fitting error between model responses and real data. The model parameters are the natural logarithms of the resistivity and the thickness in each layer of the earth. The annealing temperature decreases exponentially, while the model is refreshed randomly according to the temperature and is accepted according to a Boltzmann probability. We first tested the SA on synthetic data and developed a cooling schedule of model updates specifically for CSAMT data inversion. The redesigned cooling schedule reduces the magnitude of the model updating, and makes the solution converge rapidly and stably. For a three-layer model whose resistivity increases with depth, SA has difficulty in obtaining the global solution for the middle layer. However, the solution for such a layer can be significantly improved by using the mean value of the estimates. The inversion of field data from a northern suburb of Beijing, China, demonstrates that starting from a 1D smooth inversion to determine the range of SA parameters permits the SA to obtain very good results from the CSAMT survey data.",10.1190/geo2011-0106.1
The Average Horizontal Gravity Gradient,"The authors reported experiments of making measurements with the gravity meter at close spacings (Geophysics, 1956, 1958; Journal ASPG, 1960, 1962) for the purpose of obtaining gravity gradients and micro‐gravimetric maps. Since the average horizontal gradient seems to be of some interest for geophysical exploration, a brief theoretical discussion is presented.",10.1190/1.1439083
Long-Wavelength P-Wave And S-Wave Propagation In Jointed Rock Masses,"Field data suggest that stress level and joint condition affect shear-wave propagation in jointed rock masses. However, the study of long-wavelength propagation in a jointed rock mass is challenging in the laboratory, and limited data are available under controlled test conditions. Long-wavelength P-wave and S-wave propagation normal to joints, using an axially loaded jointed column device, reproduces a range of joint conditions. The effects of the normal stress, loading history, joint spacing, matched surface topography (i.e., joint roughness), joint cementation (e.g., after grouting), joint opening, and plasticity of the joint filling on the P-wave and S-wave velocities and on S-wave attenuation are notable. The ratio    VP ∕ VS    in jointed rock masses differs from that found in homogeneous continua. The concept of Poisson's ratio as a function of    VP ∕ VS    is unwarranted, and    VP ∕ VS    can be interpreted in terms of jointed characteristics. Analytic models that consider stress-dependent stiffness and frictional loss in joints as well as stress-independent properties of intact rocks can model experimental observations properly and extract joint properties from rock-mass test data. Thus, joint properties and normal stress have a prevalent role in propagation velocity and attenuation in jointed rock masses.",10.1190/1.3196240
An Accurate Formulation Of Log‐Stretch Dip Moveout In The Frequency‐Wavenumber Domain,"Dip moveout (DMO) processing is a partial prestack migration procedure that has been widely used in seismic data processing. The DMO process has been described in Deregowski (1986), Hale (1991) and Liner (1990). Many different DMO algorithms have been developed over the past decade. These algorithms have been designed to improve either the accuracy or the computational speed of the DMO process. Hale (1984) developed a method for performing DMO via Fourier transforms that is accurate for all reflector dips (assuming constant velocity). Hale's method is computationally expensive because his DMO operator is temporally nonstationary, but its accuracy and simplicity have made it an industry standard. It has become a benchmark by which results from other DMO algorithms are judged. Of all the methods used to make the frequency‐domain DMO computationally efficient, the technique of logarithmic time stretching, first suggested in Bolondi et al. (1982), is widely used. After logarithmic stretching of the time axis, the DMO operator becomes temporally stationary which enables replacement of the slow temporal Fourier integration with a fast Fourier transform combined with a simple phase shift. Bale and Jakubowicz (1987) presented a log‐stretch DMO operator (hereafter referred to as Bale's DMO) in the frequency‐wavenumber (F-K) domain without approximations, while Notfors and Godfrey (1987) suggested an approximate version of log‐stretch DMO operator (hereafter referred to as Notfors's DMO). Surprisingly, Bale's full log‐stretch DMO operator produces a less satisfactory impulse response than Notfors's approximate log‐stretch DMO scheme (see Liner, 1990). Liner (1990) attributed this characteristic to the fact that Bale's DMO derivation implicitly assumes that the Fourier transform frequency in the log‐stretch domain is not time‐dependant. He presented an exact log‐stretch DMO operator (hereafter referred to as Liner's DMO) which was derived by transforming the time log‐stretched Hale's (t, x) DMO impulse response into the Fourier domain. Its derivation is relatively complicated, but Liner has shown that his DMO does generate good DMO impulse responses.",10.1190/1.1444006

The Effect Of Grain Anisotropy On The Electrical Properties Of Sedimentary Rocks,"We have examined the effect of particulate anisotropy on the electrical properties of sedimentary rocks by generalizing the treatment of Sen et al (1981) to the case of ellipsoidal grains with a distribution of orientations and depolarizing factors. Two distributions in orientation have been treated in detail—randomly oriented grains in three dimensions and grains with aligned principal axes in two dimensions. In the former case the conductivity is a scalar satisfying Archie's law, σ=σwϕm, with σw the conductivity of the pore fluid and ϕ the porosity. The exponent m has a minimum of 1.5 for spherical grains. The presence of highly oblate (disk shaped) grains raises m significantly. As long as grains with extremely large eccentricities (≳15) are not present, the exponent falls in the observed range 1.2≲m≲4. For aligned grains the conductivity is a tensor with principal values that satisfy a generalized Archie's law of the form σj=aj(ϕ)σwϕm, where σj is the jth principal value of the conductivity and aj(ϕ) can be expanded as a power series in ϕ with a constant leading term. For grain eccentricities in the range 0–0.95, the coefficients aj fall in the range 0.1–4. The exponent m has a minimum value of 2 for two dimensions, independent of grain shape, if all grains have the same shape, and it is larger for any distribution of grain shapes. If the distribution of grain shapes is chosen so that the rock is isotropic, m and a have the same values as for isotropic rock composed of grains with the same distribution of shapes but with random orientations. Since different distributions of grain orientation can lead to the same effective conductivity, it is clear that measurements of dc conductivity are not sufficient to determine the grain distribution. The model is also used to obtain the complex dielectric constant. If the dielectric constant of solid rock is small compared to the real part of the dielectric constant of water, the complex dielectric constant has the same dependence on porosity as the dc conductivity except at very small porosities.",10.1190/1.1441332
Ambiguities In Avo Inversion Of Reflections From A Gas‐Sand,"We examine the reflections from a thick sand layer embedded in shales deposited in an open marine environment of Miocene age. Borehole data indicate that the sand bed is gas saturated. Making the assumptions of single interface reflections, plane‐wave propagation in elastic and isotropic media, and correct amplitude recovery of the actual seismic data, we try to invert the amplitude variation with offset (AVO) response for the compressional velocity (α2), shear velocity (β2), and density (ρ2) of the gas‐sand layer, knowing the parameters of the upper layer and the calibration constant. The actual reflections reach incidence angles up to 54 degrees at the farthest offset. Notwithstanding the large range of incidence angles, the outcomes of the inversion are ambiguous for we find many solutions that fit equally well, in a least‐squares sense, the observed AVO response. We present the locus of the solutions as curves in compressional velocity (α2), shear velocity (β2), and density (ρ2) space. To gain a better understanding of the results, we also perform the same inversion experiment on synthetic AVO data derived from the borehole information. We find that when inverting the AVO response in the same range of incidence angles as in the real data case, the exact solution is found whichever starting point we choose; that is, we have no ambiguity. However, if we limit the incidence angle range, e.g., to 15 degrees, the invention is no longer able to find a unique solution and the set of admissible solutions defines regular curves in α2, β2, ρ2 space. We infer that residual noise in the recorded data is responsible for the ambiguities of the solutions, and that because of numerical noise, a wide range of incidence angle is required to obtain a unique solution even in noise‐free synthetic data.",10.1190/1.1443740
Induced Polarization And Pore Radius — A Discussion,"Permeability estimation from induced polarization (IP) measurements is based on a fundamental premise that the characteristic relaxation time τ is related to the effective hydraulic radius reff controlling fluid flow. The approach requires a reliable estimate of the diffusion coefficient of the ions in the electrical double layer. Others have assumed a value for the diffusion coefficient, or postulated different values for clay versus clay-free rocks. We have examined the link between a widely used single estimate of τ and reff for an extensive database of sandstone samples, in which mercury porosimetry data confirm that reff is reliably determined from a modification of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation assuming that the electrical tortuosity is equal to the hydraulic tortuosity. Our database does not support the existence of one or two distinct representative diffusion coefficients but instead demonstrates strong evidence for six orders of magnitude of variation in an apparent diffusion coefficient that is well-correlated with reff and the specific surface area per unit pore volume Spor. Two scenarios can explain our findings: (1) the length scale defined by τ is not equal to reff and is likely much longer due to the control of pore-surface roughness or (2) the range of diffusion coefficients is large and likely determined by the relative proportions of the different minerals (e.g., silica and clays) making up the rock. In either case, the estimation of reff (and hence permeability) is inherently uncertain from a single characteristic IP relaxation time as considered in this study.",10.1190/geo2016-0135.1
Relating Shear Sonic Anisotropy Directions To Stress In Deviated Wells,"We develop a model that relates the polarization direction of a dipole sonic fast shear wave propagating along the borehole (hereafter called FSA) to the relative deviatoric stress tensor for arbitrary well orientations. We first define stress quantities, or ""subsidiary principal stress,"" relevant for sonic dipole shear characterized sufficiently far away into the formation to be unaffected by borehole stress concentration. Next, we show analytically for wells oriented within principal stress planes and numerically for wells outside principal stress planes that the stress-induced FSA coincides with the maximum normal stress direction orthogonal to the borehole (""maximum subsidiary principal stress"") using a nonlinear elastic model for isotropic unstressed background media and plane wave solutions. This model is independent of stress sensitivity parameters. This result is a consequence of, first, the direct relationship between the stressellipsoid factor and the shear stiffness difference ratio,   R≡ ( σ2 − σ3 ) ∕ ( σ1 − σ3 ) = ( c55 − c66 ) ∕ ( c44 − c66 )   , and, second, the almost elliptical nature of stress-induced orthorhombic media. Using published laboratory data relating stiffnesses to applied differential stress for isotropic unstressed limestone and sandstone rocks, the model is confirmed for most well orientations except in the vicinity of the stress nodal point within the maximum and minimum principal stress plane, due to small anellipticity as stress increases. The orientations near the nodal point are also the zones of weakest stress-induced anisotropy zones and are therefore the least likely to be measured in practice as long as a quality indicator depending on both the degree of anellipticity and the strength of the shear anisotropy is below 0.5. Finally, we present a synthetic example of the application of this model to estimate the relative deviatoric stress tensor using two wells with different orientations.",10.1190/1.3481651
Early Arrival Waveform Tomography On Near-Surface Refraction Data,"We develop a waveform-tomography method for estimating the velocity distribution that minimizes the waveform misfit between the predicted and observed early arrivals in space-time seismograms. By fitting the waveforms of early arrivals, early arrival waveform tomography (EWT) naturally takes into account more general wave-propagation effects compared to the high-frequency method of traveltime tomography, meaning that EWT can estimate a wider range of slowness wavenumbers. Another benefit of EWT is more reliable convergence compared to full-waveform tomography, because an early-arrival misfit function contains fewer local minima. Synthetic test results verify that the waveform tomogram is much more accurate than the traveltime tomogram and that this algorithm has good convergence properties. For marine data from the Gulf of Mexico, the statics problem caused by shallow, gassy muds was attacked by using EWT to obtain a more accurate velocity model. Using the waveform tomogram to correct for statics, the stacked section was significantly improved compared to using the normal move-out (NMO) velocity, and moderately improved compared to using the traveltime tomogram. Inverting high-resolution land data from Mapleton, Utah, showed an EWT velocity tomogram that was more consistent with the ground truth (trench log) than the traveltime tomogram. Our results suggest that EWT can provide supplemental, shorter-wavelength information compared to the traveltime tomogram for both shallow and moderately deep seismic data.",10.1190/1.2210969
Applications Of Green'S Theorem In Two‐Dimensional Filtering,There seems to be considerable interest in the design of a discrete two‐dimensional filter from band‐pass and band‐reject area specification in the ω‐k plane. The calculation of such a filter requires the evaluation of a double integral for each filter point. Considerable effort has been expended in efforts to give the results of these integrations in closed form for special cases. The present note was written to point out that a rather general class of filters can be calculated from a single computer program. The simplicity of this program is a result of an elementary application of Green's Theorem in the plane.,10.1190/1.1439887
Mode Misidentification In Rayleigh Waves: Ellipticity As A Cause And A Cure,"The surface wave method is a popular tool for geotechnical characterization because it supplies a cost-effective testing procedure capable of retrieving the shear wave velocity structure of the near-surface. Several acquisition and processing approaches have been developed to infer the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve which is then inverted. Typically, in active testing, single-component vertical receivers are used. In most cases, the inversion is carried out assuming that the experimental dispersion curve corresponds to a single mode, mostly the fundamental Rayleigh mode, unless clear evidence dictates the existence of a more complex response, e.g., in presence of low-velocity layers and inversely dispersive sites. A correct identification of the modes is essential to avoid serious errors. Here we consider the typical case of higher-mode misidentification known as ""osculation"" (""kissing""), where the energy peak shifts at low frequencies from the fundamental to the first higher mode. This jump occurs, with a continuous smooth transition, around a well-defined frequency where the two modes get very close to each other. Osculation happens generally in presence of strong velocity contrasts, typically with a fast bedrock underlying loose sediments. The practical limitations of the acquired active data affect the spectral and modal resolution, making it often impossible to identify the presence of two modes. In some cases, modes have a very close root and cannot be separated at the osculation point. In such cases, mode misidentification can create a large overestimation of the bedrock velocity and a large error on its depth. We examine the subsoil conditions that can generate this unwanted condition, and the common field acquisition procedures that can contribute to producing data having such deceptive Rayleigh dispersion characteristics. This mode misidentification depends strongly on the usual approach of measuring only the vertical component of ground motion, as the mode osculation is linked to the Rayleigh wave ellipticity polarization, and therefore we conclude that multicomponent data, using also horizontal receivers, can help discern the multimodal nature of surface waves. Finally, we introduce a priori detectors of subsoil conditions, based on passive microtremor measurements, that can act as warnings against the presence of mode osculation, and relate these detectors to the frequencies at which dispersion curves can be misidentified. Theoretical results are confirmed by real data acquisition tests.",10.1190/geo2012-0194.1
Spectral Signatures Of Particulate Minerals In The Visible And Near Infrared,"The utility of multispectral remote sensing techniques for discriminating among materials is based on the differences that exist among their spectral properties. As distinct from spectral variations that occur as a consequence of target condition and environmental factors, intrinsic spectral features that appear in the form of bands and slopes in the visible and near infrared (.325 to 2.5 μm) bidirectional reflection spectra of minerals (and, consequently, rocks) are caused by a variety of electronic and vibrational processes. These processes, such as crystal field effects, charge‐transfer, color centers, transitions to the conduction band, and overtone and combination tone vibrational transitions are discussed and illustrated with reference to specific minerals. Spectral data collected from a large selection of minerals are used to generate a ""spectral signature"" diagram that summarizes the optimum intrinsic information available from the spectra of particulate minerals. The diagram provides a ready reference for the interpretation of visible and near infrared features that typically appear in remotely sensed data. In the visible‐near infrared region, the most commonly observed features in naturally occurring materials are due to the presence of iron in some form or other, or to the presence of water or OH groups.",10.1190/1.1440721
A Photoelastic Study Of Stress Wave Propagation In A Quarter‐Plane,"An experimental investigation was conducted on a quarter‐plane loaded with an explosive charge at one point on the boundary. Experimental methods of dynamic photoelasticity and interferometry were used to obtain full‐field data of the dynamic event. Results of the study were obtained for both the P and R‐wave interaction with the corner. Energy reflection coefficients were found for the P‐wave interaction. For the Rayleigh wave, where the response was more significant, transmission and reflection coefficients based on both stress and surface energy were established. Subsurface stress distributions for the transmitted and reflected Rayleigh waves were obtained in the region near the corner.",10.1190/1.1440170
"Hopfield Neural Networks, And Mean Field Annealing For Seismic Deconvolution And Multiple Attenuation","We describe a global optimization method called mean field annealing (MFA) and its application to two basic problems in seismic data processing: Seismic deconvolution and surface related multiple attenuation. MFA replaces the stochastic nature of the simulated annealing method with a set of deterministic update rules that act on the average value of the variables rather than on the variables themselves, based on the mean field approximation. As the temperature is lowered, the MFA rules update the variables in terms of their values at a previous temperature. By minimizing averages, it is possible to converge to an equilibrium state considerably faster than a standard simulated annealing method. The update rules are dependent on the form of the cost function and are obtained easily when the cost function resembles the energy function of a Hopfield network. The mapping of a problem onto a Hopfield network is not a precondition for using MFA, but it makes analytic calculations simpler. The seismic deconvolution problem can be mapped onto a Hopfield network by parameterizing the source and the reflectivity in terms of binary neurons. In this context, the solution of the problem is obtained when the neurons of the network reach their stable states. By minimizing the cost function of the network with MFA and using an appropriate cooling schedule, it is possible to escape local minima. A similar idea can also be applied to design an operator that attenuates surface related multiple reflections from plane‐wave transformed seismograms assuming a 1-D earth. The cost function for the multiple elimination problem is based on the criterion of minimum energy of the multiple suppressed data.",10.1190/1.1444205
Aeromagnetic Regional Survey Of Onshore Australia,"The Australian Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) is responsible for the National Airborne Magnetic Database. This data base consists of results from approximately 3 500 000 line‐km of regional survey flying carried out over 35 years, recording total magnetic intensity. The magnetic data base is one of the most important geophysical data bases for Australia and is used extensively by the minerals and petroleum exploration industries. First‐pass coverage of onshore Australia is aimed for completion in 1992. This coverage contains data from surveys with a wide range of specifications, resulting in a wide range of data quality; some of the areas covered by poorer quality data may be reflown later. For the most part, the intention has been to acquire data at a continuous ground clearance of 150 m and with a line spacing of 1500 m. However, over some sedimentary basins, the line spacing is in excess of 3200 m. New color and grey‐scale (image processed type) digital magnetic maps (pixel maps) are in preparation; these will supersede the 1976 digital magnetic map of Australia, which was gridded on a 1.2 minute mesh (2000 m) mostly by digitizing contours on maps. The new map, produced from flight‐line data, will have a grid size of 0.25 minutes. Initially, a series of maps will be produced with each one covering a block of 4 degrees latitude by 6 degrees longitude, coinciding with standard 1 : 1 000 000 map sheets. An example included for the Adelaide 1 : 1 000 000 map sheet in Southern Australia shows a dramatic increase in the number of anomalies over those that were evident in earlier contour presentations.",10.1190/1.1442460
Geometrical Ray Theory: Edge‐Diffracted Rays And Their Traveltimes (Second‐Order Approximation Of The Traveltimes),"The general laws presenting global properties of reflected and transmitted rays are extended to the edge‐diffracted rays by the use of the law of edge diffraction. Similar to reflected and transmitted rays, edge‐diffracted rays and their traveltimes are described by the same four 2 × 2 matrices that are submatrices of the symplectic ray transformation matrix. If the incident rays have no line and point focus in the reflector having edges, one cone of diffracted rays corresponds just to one diffraction point. Otherwise, there may be an infinite number of cones of diffracted rays that are from one and the same diffraction point, and there may be no diffracted ray if the incident rays have a point focus in the reflecting surface with edges. For some cases, edge diffractions are the same as those from point diffractors and all diffracted rays are focused on the point focus of the reflected rays in the earth's surface.",10.1190/1.1443526
A New Parameterization For Waveform Inversion In Acoustic Orthorhombic Media,"Orthorhombic anisotropic model inversion is extra challenging because of the multiple parameter nature of the inversion problem. The high number of parameters required to describe the medium exerts considerable trade-off and additional nonlinearity to a full-waveform inversion (FWI) application. Choosing a suitable set of parameters to describe the model and designing an effective inversion strategy can help in mitigating this problem. Using the Born approximation, which is the central ingredient of the FWI update process, we have derived radiation patterns for the different acoustic orthorhombic parameterizations. Analyzing the angular dependence of scattering (radiation patterns) of the parameters of different parameterizations starting with the often used Thomsen-Tsvankin parameterization, we have assessed the potential trade-off between the parameters and the resolution in describing the data and inverting for the parameters. The analysis led us to introduce new parameters εd, δd, and ηd, which have azimuthally dependent radiation patterns, but keep the scattering potential of the transversely isotropic parameters stationary with azimuth (azimuth independent). The novel parameters εd, δd, and ηd are dimensionless and represent a measure of deviation between the vertical planes in orthorhombic anisotropy. Therefore, these deviation parameters offer a new parameterization style for an acoustic orthorhombic medium described by six parameters: three vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) parameters, two deviation parameters, and one parameter describing the anisotropy in the horizontal symmetry plane. The main feature of any parameterization based on the deviation parameters, is the azimuthal independency of the modeled data with respect to the VTI parameters, which allowed us to propose practical inversion strategies based on our experience with the VTI parameters. This feature of the new parameterization style holds for even the long-wavelength components of the model constrained by traveltimes.",10.1190/geo2015-0635.1
Evaluation Of A Rapid Hybrid Spectral-Spatial Domain 3D Forward-Modeling Approach For Loop-Loop Electromagnetic Induction Quadrature Data Acquired In Low-Induction-Number Environments,"When exploring subsurface environments using electromagnetic (EM) induction (EMI) tools, approximate forward-modeling methods based on a homogeneous half-space kernel have been extensively evaluated in the past. For large-scale exploration methods, such as magnetotellurics, marine EM, airborne EM, transient EM, and large offset loop-loop harmonic EM, such forward-modeling approaches are limited because the kernel depends strongly on the subsurface distribution of electrical conductivity. However, the response of small portable EMI loop-loop sensors applied in a low-induction number (LIN) context are known to be more linearly related to the true distribution of electrical conductivity. Thus, data collected using such sensors are more adapted to an approximate forward-modeling with a conductivity-independent kernel. We have evaluated the bias of such an approximate modeling for the case of portable multiconfiguration system measurements in 1D, 2D, and 3D contexts. Our result shows that the approximate approach tends to underestimate the conductivity of more conductive targets but is able to reproduce the right structural information. Compared with previous algorithms presented in the literature, we solved the approximate forward-modeling problem in the hybrid spectral-spatial domain to speed up the computation. Considering the level of accuracy in structural modeling as well as the computational efficiency of our hybrid spectral-spatial approach, we conclude that this method is especially suitable for near-surface, large-scale mapping applications in LIN environments as typically encountered in soil sciences and archaeological studies. For such applications, our approach can be implemented in rapid multichannel deconvolution procedures.",10.1190/geo2015-0584.1
High‐Resolution Crosswell Imaging Of A West Texas Carbonate Reservoir: Part 3—Wavefield Separation Of Reflections,"Using crosswell data collected at a depth of about 3000 ft (900 m) in west Texas carbonates, one of the first well‐to‐well reflection images of an oil reservoir was produced. The P and S brute stack reflection images created after wavefield separation tied the sonic logs and exhibited a vertical resolution that was comparable to well log resolution. Both brute stacks demonstrated continuity of several reflectors known to be continuous from log control and also imaged an angular unconformity that was not detected in log correlations or in surface seismic profiling. The brute stacks, particularly the S‐wave reflection image, also exhibited imaging artifacts. We found that multichannel wavefield separation filters that attenuated interfering wavemodes were a critical component in producing high‐resolution reflection images. In this study, the most important elements for an effective wavefield separation were the time‐alignment of seismic arrivals prior to filter application and the implementation of wavefield‐separation filters in multiple domains, particularly in common offset domain. The effectiveness of the multichannel filtering was enhanced through the use of extremely fine wellbore sampling intervals. In this study, 2.5 ft (0.76 m) vertical sampling intervals for both source and receiver were used, whereas most previous crosswell data sets were collected with much coarser sampling intervals, resulting in spatial aliasing and limiting the utility of the data for reflection processing. The wavefield separation techniques employed in this study used data volumes and associated filtering operations that were several orders of magnitude larger than those encountered in conventional VSP data analysis.",10.1190/1.1443808
The Physics And Simulation Of Wave Propagation At The Ocean Bottom,"We investigate some aspects of the physics of wave propagation at the ocean bottom (ranging from soft sediments to crustal rocks). Most of the phenomena are associated to the presence of attenuation. The analysis requires the use of an anelastic stress‐strain relation and a highly accurate modeling algorithm. Special attention is given to modeling the boundary conditions at the ocean‐bottom interface and the related physical phenomena. For this purpose, we further develop and test the pseudospectral modeling algorithm for wave propagation at fluid‐anelastic solid interfaces. The method is based on a domain‐decomposition technique (one grid for the fluid part and another grid for the solid part) and the Fourier and Chebyshev differential operators. We consider the reflection, transmission, and propagation of seismic waves at the ocean bottom, modeled as a plane boundary separating an acoustic medium (ocean) and a viscoelastic solid (sediment). The main physical phenomena associated with this interface are illustrated, namely, amplitude variations with offset, the Rayleigh window, and the propagation of Scholte and leaky Rayleigh waves. Modeling anelasticity is essential to describe these effects, in particular, amplitude variations near and beyond the critical angle, the Rayleigh window, and the dissipation of the fundamental interface mode. The physics of wave propagation is investigated by means of a plane‐wave analysis and the novel modeling algorithm. A wavenumber–frequency domain method is used to compute the reflection coefficient and phase angle from the synthetic seismograms. This method serves to verify the algorithm, which is shown to model with high accuracy the Rayleigh‐window phenomenon and the propagation of interface waves. The modeling is further verified by comparisons with the analytical solution for a fluid‐solid interface in lossless media, with source and receivers away from and at the ocean bottom. Using the pseudospectral modeling code, which allows general material variability, a complete and accurate characterization of the seismic response of the ocean bottom can be obtained. An example illustrates the effects of attenuation on the propagation of dispersive Scholte waves at the bottom of the North Sea.",10.1190/1.1759469
Interpolation And Multiple Attenuation With Migration Operators,"A hyperbolic Radon transform (RT) can be applied with success to attenuate or interpolate hyperbolic events in seismic data. However, this method fails when the hyperbolic events have apexes located at nonzero offset positions. A different RT operator is required for these cases, an operator that scans for hyperbolas with apexes centered at any offset. This procedure defines an extension of the standard hyperbolic RT with hyperbolic basis functions located at every point of the data gather. The mathematical description of such an operator is basically similar to a kinematic poststack time‐migration equation, with the horizontal coordinate being not midpoint but offset. In this paper, this transformation is implemented by using a least‐squares conjugate gradient algorithm with a sparseness constraint. Two different operators are considered, one in the time domain and the other in the frequency‐wavenumber domain (Stolt operator). The sparseness constraint in the time‐offset domain is essential for resampling and for interpolation. The frequency‐wavenumber domain operator is very efficient, not much more expensive in computation time than a sparse parabolic RT, and much faster than a standard hyperbolic RT. Examples of resampling, interpolation, and coherent noise attenuation using the frequency‐wavenumber domain operator are presented. Near and far offset gaps are interpolated in synthetic and real shot gathers, with simultaneous resampling beyond aliasing. Waveforms are well preserved in general except when there is little coherence in the data outside the gaps or events with very different velocities are located at the same time. Multiples of diffractions are predicted and attenuated by subtraction from the data.",10.1190/1.1635058
Sand And Gravel Prospecting By The Earth Resistivity Method,The four electrode earth‐resistivity method is applied to the search for sand and gravel deposits in the glaciated areas of the United States. This technique differentiates between clays and granular materials enabling the prospector to outline and roughly estimate the quantities of each without test pits or bore holes. Several examples of field surveys are given.,10.1190/1.1445066
Velocity Anisotropy Measurements In Wells,"Sedimentary rocks are generally anisotropic to the propagation of seismic waves. Anisotropy can be defined as the difference between propagation time predicted by the simple theory of Snell's Law and observed propagation time between two points in a layered medium that lie on a line oblique to the layers. This difference can be explained by the more complicated theory of wave propagation in transversely isotropic materials. In the zone about the vertical that is of interest in reflection seismology, the effect of anisotropy usually can be described geometrically by an anisotropy factor A. This simple description is not valid for propagation directions making large angles with the normal to the layers. The anisotropy factor as well as the vertical velocity can vary with depth. A method is given for determining the factor A as a function of depth from a continuous velocity log and a range of oblique shots into a well phone. The method is applied to two field examples. In one of the examples, it is shown by data obtained from the larger shooting distances that the simple A factor description is inadequate for higher angles of propagation direction.",10.1190/1.1439822
A Combined Time-Frequency Filtering Strategy For Q-Factor Compensation Of Poststack Seismic Data,"Attenuation is one of the main factors responsible for limiting resolution of the seismic method. It selectively damps the higher frequency components of the signal more strongly, causing the earth to work as a low-pass filter. This loss of high-frequency energy may be partially compensated by application of inverse Q filtering routines. However, such routines often increase the noise level of the data, thereby restricting their use. These filters also require a quality factor profile as an input parameter, which is rarely available. In recent years, alternative methods for stable inverse Q filtering have been presented in the literature, which makes it possible to correct the attenuation without introducing so much noise. In addition, new methods have been proposed to estimate the quality factor from seismic reflection data. We have developed a three-stage workflow oriented for attenuation correction in stacked sections. In the first stage, a trace-by-trace estimate of the quality factor is performed along the section. The second stage consists of preparing the data for attenuation compensation, which is performed via a special filtering strategy for efficient noise removal to avoid high-frequency noise bursts. The last stage is the application of a stable inverse Q filtering. As an example, we applied the proposed flow in a seismic section to compensate for the attenuation caused by shallow gas accumulation. Careful data preparation proved to be a key factor in achieving successful attenuation compensation.",10.1190/geo2015-0470.1
Exact Equations For Fluid And Solid Substitution,"We derived exact equations, elastic bulk and shear, for fluid and solid substitution in monomineralic isotropic rocks of arbitrary pore shape and suggested methods to obtain the required substitution parameters. We proved that the classical Gassmann's bulk modulus equation for fluid-to-fluid substitution is exact for solid-to-solid substitution if compression-induced mean stresses (pressure) in initial and final pore solids are homogeneous and either the shear modulus of the substituted solid does not change or no shear stress is induced in pores. Moreover, when compression-induced mean stresses in initial and final pore solids are homogeneous, we evaluated exact generalizations of Gassmann's bulk modulus equation, which depend on usually known parameters. For the effective shear modulus, we found general exactness conditions of Gassmann and other approximations. Using the new exact substitution equations, we interpreted that predicting solid-filled rock stiffness from a dry rock stiffness measurement requires more information (i.e., assumptions about the pore shape) compared to predicting the same from a fluid-saturated rock stiffness.",10.1190/geo2013-0187.1
3D Block Qt Inversion Of Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data,"Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (surface NMR) has up to now rarely been applied to 3D subsurface modeling. Inversion approaches currently in use are smooth inversion techniques that are not useful for identifying sharp geologic boundaries. Although they are already computationally expensive, the resulting models are restricted to imaging the subsurface water content distribution and do not deliver relaxation times T2* based on the QT inversion scheme established elsewhere. We have developed a method of 3D block QT inversion that uses horizontal smoothness constraints to resolve sharp boundaries in the vertical direction and the distributions of the water content and relaxation time T2*. We have improved the computational efficiency, i.e., the ability to perform the inversion using a common desktop computer, by gating the surface NMR data, reducing the model space to monoexponential decays within the subsurface bodies, and inverting based on blocklike structures instead of smooth distributions. We have developed a synthetic study to assess the effectiveness of our block QT inversion technique in imaging 3D water content distributions, and we compared the results with those of a smooth inversion. Furthermore, we evaluated results from a field survey conducted on the frozen surface of an artificial lake. We found that our block QT inversion approach provides results that are superior to those of smooth inversion and consistent with the available construction plan of the lake. We expect that 3D block QT inversion will be a useful approach also in other geologic settings, such as buried valleys, because it overcomes the current limitations of applying 3D surface NMR inversion.",10.1190/geo2015-0582.1
Frequency Dispersion In Finite‐Difference Migration,"We introduce a practical measure that predicts the frequency dispersion in implicit time‐domain finite‐difference migration. This measure of dispersion can be readily computed as a function of velocity, dip, and the sampling parameters (depth interval, time interval, trace interval). One result of this analysis is that smaller sampling intervals can often lead to poorer results by an unbalancing of canceling errors. Another result is that, even if the errors are kept in balance for one event, it is not possible to minimize simultaneously the dispersion for all events, since many different dips and velocities occur on a typical seismic section. We also extend the computation of the dispersion measure to include cascaded finite‐difference migration. Cascading does not reduce the magnitude of wavelet dispersion, but it does make the control of dispersion easier because it avoids the problem of choosing parameters in the presence of multivalued velocity. We calibrate and confirm our theoretical dispersion measure by means of migration tests on model data and field data.",10.1190/1.1442607
Hybrid Combination Genetic Algorithm And Controlled Gradient Method To Train A Neural Network,"Multivariate predictive analysis is a widely used tool in the petroleum industry in situations in which the deterministic nature of the relationship between a variable that requires prediction and a variable that is used for the purposes of such prediction is unknown or very complex. For example, to perform a sweet-spot analysis, it is necessary to predict potential oil and gas production rates on a map, using various geologic and geophysical attribute maps (porosity, density, seismic attributes, gravity, magnetic, etc.) and the initial oil and gas production rates of several control or training wells located in the area of interest. We have developed a new technology that allows for building a stable nonlinear predictive operator by using the combination of a neural network, a genetic algorithm, and a controlled gradient method. The main idea behind the proposed technology is to combine stochastic and deterministic approaches during the construction of the predictive operator at the training stage. The proposed technology avoids many disadvantages of the genetic algorithm and gradients methods, such as a high level of dependency on the initial values; the phenomenon of over-fitting (overtraining), which results in creation of an operator with unstable predictability; and a low speed of decreasing error during iteration, and, as a result, a low level of prediction quality. However, the above-mentioned combination uses the advantages of both methods and allows for finding a solution significantly closer to a global minimum for the objective function, compared to simple gradient methods, such as back propagation. The combination of these methods together with Tikhonov regularization allows for building stable predictions in spatial or/and time coordinates.",10.1190/geo2015-0297.1
Exploring For Ancient Channels With The Refraction Seismograph,"In the Monument Valley of Arizona and Utah, uranium ore has been found in ancient channel deposits, primarily in the Shinarump member of the Chinle formation of Late Triassic age. The seismic velocity in the Shinarump member is substantially less than that in the Moenkopi formation of Early and Middle(?) Triassic age, which unconformably underlies the Shinarump. Therefore, the ancient channels can be located by using the refraction seismograph. Because the erosion surface of the Moenkopi in channel areas is curved. a delay‐time method of analysis is used to determine the position in depth of the Shinarump and Moenkopi contact. The problem of velocity variations within the Shinarump can be largely overcome by careful interpretation supported by drill‐hole and velocity control.",10.1190/1.1438336
Free-Surface Multiple Attenuation Using Inverse Data Processing In The Coupled Plane-Wave Domain,"Free-surface multiples contain a large amount of energy in the seismic data because of large reflectivity of the free surface. We propose a method for free-surface multiple attenuation by a simple muting in the inverse coupled plane-wave domain. Our method is based on inverse data processing and the well-known 2D invariant embedding technique. If the lateral variation in subsurface structure is smooth, the data are well compressed in the 2D coupled plane-wave domain, reducing computation costs and stabilizing the inversion procedure. Surface multiples and primaries are well separated in the inverse coupled plane-wave domain, and multiples can be eliminated by simple muting, which does not damage the primary energy. To reduce artifacts, wraparound, and noise introduced by the frequency-domain data matrix inversion, horizontal and vertical tapers are applied. A least-squares matrix inversion method is chosen to stabilize the inversion. Synthetic data examples show that plane-wave inverse data processing is stable and successful in attenuating free-surface multiples.",10.1190/1.3137059
Can We Image Complex Structures With First‐Arrival Traveltime?,"We experienced difficulties when attempting to perform seismic imaging in complex velocity fields using prestack Kirchhoff depth migration in conjunction with traveltimes computed by finite‐differencing the eikonal equation. The problem arose not because of intrinsic limitations of Kirchhoff migration, but rather from the failure of finite‐differencing to compute traveltimes representative of the energetic part of the wavefield. Further analysis showed that the first arrival is most often associated with a marginally energetic event wherever subsequent arrivals exist. The consequence is that energetic seismic events are imaged with a kinematically incorrect operator and turn out mispositioned at depth. We therefore recommend that first‐arrival traveltime fields, such as those computed by finite‐differencing the eikonal equation, be used in Kirchhoff migration only with great care when the velocity field hosts multiple transmitted arrivals; such a situation is typically met where geological structure creates strong and localized velocity heterogeneities, which partition the incident and reflected wavefields into multiple arrivals; in such an instance, imaging cannot be strictly considered a kinematic process, as it must be performed with explicit reference to the relative amplitudes of multiple arrivals.",10.1190/1.1443439
The Application Of Homomorphic Deconvolution To Shallow‐Water Marine Seismology—Part Ii: Real Data,"The application of the techniques of Part I to seismic reflection data acquired on the Argentine continental shelf yields results which appear superior to time‐domain, minimum‐phase inverse filtering via the auto‐correlation function. This is in part because of a narrow‐band, maximum‐phase source component. Minimum‐phase deconvolution disperses this component rather than compressing it. Very slight exponential weighting (at,a=0.998) appears to make the reflector series minimum phase. This weighting in conjunction with quadrupling the trace length by extending it with zeros virtually eliminates aliasing in the complex cepstrum. Simple zeroing of the complex‐cepstrum terms works well as a deconvolution technique even though for exactness their harmonics at longer cepstrum periods should also be removed.",10.1190/1.1440439
The Peak Frequency Of Direct Waves For Microseismic Events,"Direct seismic waves (P- or S-waves) are used to locate and further characterize microseismic events. The resolution of information obtained from direct waves depends on the peak frequencies of the waveforms. The peak frequency results from combination of the source, propagation, and the receiver effects. For frequencies below the corner frequency, propagation effects control the peak frequency in observed seismograms of microseismic events. The frequency dependence of direct body waves can be modeled by attenuation, specifically the global attenuation factor. This model is consistent with observed data along surface profiles explaining the difference between the peak frequencies of P- and S-waves. In addition, the model is consistent with the peak frequencies observed on downhole monitoring arrays. This can be used to invert effective attenuation providing additional unique measurement from microseismic events. The corner frequency can be estimated from the average stress drop and analytical source models such as a circular crack model. Typical stress drops for various magnitude ranges are discussed. The peak frequencies are usually below the corner frequencies of microseismic events smaller than moment magnitude 0.7 for surface monitoring and moment magnitude −0.5 for downhole monitoring. Understanding of the frequency dependence of the direct waves allows us to optimally design monitoring networks and mainly invert effective attenuation providing unique measurement from microseismic monitoring.",10.1190/geo2013-0197.1
Higher Order Auto‐Spectra By Maximum Entropy Method,"Higher order auto‐spectra, in particular bispectra and perhaps trispectra, are being used increasingly for analyzing various nonlinear interactions in the ocean, e.g., Herring (1980) and McComas and Briscoe (1980). The resolution of these spectra, as with conventional energy spectra, is frequently limited because short data records must be used. The purpose of this note is to present a maximum entropy (MEM) representation for higher order auto‐spectra which has the advantage of the superior resolving power of the MEM technique under these circumstances. The derivation is a generalizaton of the power spectra derived for a linear process (Box and Jenkins, 1970). We derive an MEM representation for bispectra and show that this result can be generalized to auto‐spectra of any order.",10.1190/1.1441424
High-Resolution Wave-Equation Ava Imaging: Algorithm And Tests With A Data Set From The Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin,"This paper presents a 3D least-squares wave-equation migration method that yields regularized common-image gathers (CIGs) for amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) analysis. In least-squares migration, we pose seismic imaging as a linear inverse problem; this provides at least two advantages. First, we are able to incorporate model-space weighting operators that improve the amplitude fidelity of CIGs. Second, the influence of improperly sampled data (footprint noise) can be diminished by incorporating data-space weighting operators. To investigate the viability of this class of methods for oil and gas exploration, we test the algorithm with a real-data example from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. To make our problem computationally feasible, we utilize the 3D common-azimuth approximation in the migration algorithm. The inversion algorithm uses the method of conjugate gradients with the addition of a ray-parameter-dependent smoothing constraint that minimizes sampling and aperture artifacts. We show that more robust AVA attributes can be obtained by properly selecting the model and data-space regularization operators. The algorithm is implemented in conjunction with a preconditioning strategy to accelerate convergence. Posing the migration problem as an inverse problem leads to enhanced event continuity in CIGs and, hence, more reliable AVA estimates. The vertical resolution of the inverted image also improves as a consequence of increased coherence in CIGs and, in addition, by implicitly introducing migration deconvolution in the inversion.",10.1190/1.2076748
Estimating Primaries By Sparse Inversion And Application To Near-Offset Data Reconstruction,"Accurate removal of surface-related multiples remains a challenge in many cases. To overcome typical inaccuracies in current multiple-removal techniques, we have developed a new primary-estimation method: estimation of primaries by sparse inversion (EPSI). EPSI is based on the same primary-multiple model as surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) and also requires no subsurface model. Unlike SRME, EPSI estimates the primaries as unknowns in a multidimensional inversion process rather than in a subtraction process. Furthermore, it does not depend on interpolated missing near-offset data because it can reconstruct missing data simultaneously. Sparseness plays a key role in the new primary-estimation procedure. The method was tested on 2D synthetic data.",10.1190/1.3111115
Determination Of The Potential Productivity Of Oil‐Bearing Formations By Resistivity Measurements,"Electrical logging is now almost universally applied in oil and gas fields throughout the world. The usual practice is to record the self‐potential and resistivity curves which, together, reveal the location and thickness of strata penetrated by the drill and a great deal as to their lithology and fluid content. The resistivity log thus obtained serves very well to disclose in detail formations penetrated and to distinguish between oil and water. With the device used for ordinary electrical logging purposes, the true resistivity of the formation is not measured. The recorded resistivity is only an apparent value which is governed by several influencing factors, besides the true resistivity of the formation and its fluid content. As applied to the oil content of a formation, it is a qualitative measurement, merely showing the vertical extent of the oil accumulation. Experience has shown that the electrical conductance of oil sands is due to connate water held by molecular forces to the sand grains. Research has disclosed a definite mathematical relationship between the true resistivity of an oil sand and the ratio of its oil and connate water. This leads the way to a new practical application of electrical logging. By using a suitable combination of measuring devices, the true resistivity of an oil sand may be measured in an oil well. The true resistivity measurement, used in conjunction with other field and laboratory data, may in certain cases be used quantitatively to make a determination of the net oil content of a productive layer. The method by which these measurements are obtained is described and actual examples are cited.",10.1190/1.1439502
Seismic Modeling Of Gas Chimneys,"We propose a simple acoustic model explaining the main features of gas chimneys. The main elements of the model consist of gas diffusing from a connected fracture network and into the surrounding shale creating an inhomogeneous gas saturation. The gas saturation results in an inhomogeneous fluctuating compressional velocity field that distorts seismic waves. We model the fracture network by a random-walk process constrained by maximum fracture length and angle of the fracture with respect to the vertical. The gas saturation is computed from a simple analytical solution of the diffusion equation, and pressure-wave velocities are locally obtained assuming that mixing of shale and gas occurs on a scale much smaller than seismic wavelengths. Synthetic seismic sections are then computed using the resulting inhomogeneous velocity model and shown to give rise to similar deterioration in data quality as that found in data from real gas chimneys. Also, synthetic common-midpoint (CMP) gathers show the same distorted and attenuated traveltime curves as those obtained from a real data set. The model shows clearly that the features of gas chimneys change with geological time (a model parameter in our approach), the deterioration of seismic waves being smallest just after the creation of the gas chimney. It seems likely that at least some of the features of gas chimneys can be explained by a simple elastic model in combination with gas diffusion from a fracture network.",10.1190/1.2749570
A Terracing Operator For Physical Property Mapping With Potential Field Data,"The terracing operator works iteratively on gravity or magnetic data, using the sense of the measured field's local curvature, to produce a field comprised of uniform domains separated by abrupt domain boundaries. The result is crudely proportional to a physical‐property function defined in one (profile case) or two (map case) horizontal dimensions. This result can be extended to a physical‐property model if its behavior in the third (vertical) dimension is defined, either arbitrarily or on the basis of the local geologic situation. The terracing algorithm is computationally fast and appropriate to use with very large digital data sets. Where gravity and magnetic data are both available, terracing provides an effective means by which the two data sets can be compared directly. Results of the terracing operation somewhat resemble those of conventional susceptibility (or density) mapping. In contrast with conventional susceptibility mapping, however, the terraced function is a true step function, which cannot be depicted by means of contour lines. Magnetic or gravity fields calculated from the physical‐property model do not, in general, produce an exact fit to the observed data. By intent, the terraced map is more closely analogous to a geologic map in that domains are separated by hard‐edged domain boundaries and minor within‐domain variation is neglected. The terracing operator was applied separately to aeromagnetic and gravity data from a 136 km × 123 km area in eastern Kansas. Results provide a reasonably good physical representation of both the gravity and the aeromagnetic data. Superposition of the results from the two data sets shows many areas of agreement that can be referenced to geologic features within the buried Precambrian crystalline basement. The emerging picture of basement geology is much better resolved than that obtained either from the scanty available drill data or from interpretation of the geophysical data by inspection.",10.1190/1.1442689
Synthetic And Field-Based Electrical Imaging Of A Zerovalent Iron Barrier: Implications For Monitoring Long-Term Barrier Performance,"We performed a study of electrical imaging sensitivity to geochemical alteration of a zerovalent iron permeable reactive barrier (PRB) over time. Complex-resistivity measurements of laboratory cores from an operational PRB defined the electrical properties of both unreacted and geochemically altered (reacted) iron, as well as the growth rate of the reacted front on the up gradient edge of the barrier. Laboratory results were used to generate models of the electrical structure of the PRB at 0, 15, and 30 years of operation. Synthetic cross-borehole resistivity and induced-polarization data were generated and perturbed with errors representative of noise at the site. To generate reliable images of the engineered structure, a complex-resistivity inversion was employed with a disconnect in the regularization between the part of the finite-element mesh (FEM) representing the internal structure of the barrier and the remainder of the FEM mesh.Synthetic results show that although the internal structure of inverted images at 15 and 30 years does not accurately reflect the width of the reacted front, modeled along the up-gradient edge of the barrier, perturbations to the internal structure of the imaged PRB are diagnostic of the growth of the reacted front. Cross-borehole electrical data, obtained at the field site during a 15-month period, demonstrate that the complex-resistivity algorithm can resolve reliably the PRB target using the engineering design specifications to define the correct shape of the regularization disconnect. Both resistivity and induced-polarization reciprocal errors are low, and the induced-polarization data are highly repeatable over this period. Changes in the electrical properties of the PRB over time were small but consistent with growth of a reacted front, based on the synthetic study. Significantly, resistivity imaging alone may be sufficient for long-term monitoring of precipitation, leading to reduced PRB performance.",10.1190/1.2235931
Efficient Global Optimization Of Reservoir Geomechanical Parameters Based On Synthetic Aperture Radar-Derived Ground Displacements,"When large volumes of fluids are removed from or injected into underground formations for, e.g., hydrocarbon and water production, CO2 storage, gas storage, and geothermal energy exploitation, monitoring of surface deformations coupled to numerical modeling improves our understanding of reservoir behavior. The ability to accurately simulate surface displacements, however, is often impaired by limited information on reservoir geometry, waterdrive strength, and fluid-geomechanical parameters characterizing the geologic formations of interest. We have investigated the ability of efficient global optimization (EGO) to reduce the parameter uncertainties usually affecting geomechanical modeling. EGO is used to identify the parameter set that minimizes the difference in land displacements obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived measurements and 3D geomechanical modeling. We have tested the approach on the Tengiz giant oil field, Kazakhstan, where large uncertainties affect our knowledge of geomechanical parameters and pore pressure evolution. SqueeSAR on ENVISAT and RADARSAT-1 images acquired between 2004 and 2007 provided a set of high-precision, high-areal-density subsidence measurements of the test site. Based on the available information, a 3D geomechanical model of the reservoir has been developed using the elastoplastic finite-element code GEPS3D. Our results indicated that EGO efficiently identifies the global optimum in the parameter space, yielding a significant reduction in the difference between modeled and measured land subsidence. The match between simulated and SAR-measured horizontal displacements was developed as validation of the EGO calibration, which thus proved an effective and rather inexpensive method for the simultaneous management of several uncertainties and the reliable quantification of the rock properties.",10.1190/geo2015-0402.1
Geophone Array Formation And Semblance Evaluation,"The performance of a variety of areal geophone arrays was evaluated using seismic data recorded on a dense receiver grid in a walkaway survey conducted in the Permian Basin of west Texas. Surface waves, trapped waves, and scattered energy have long been recognized as a significant noise problem in this area. Arrays were formed by extracting sets of traces from the main data set and stacking them to produce individual traces of a receiver gather. We calculated semblance of each receiver gather to evaluate array performance. High values of semblance indicate that an array effectively removes surface waves while preserving reflections. Differences in data quality associated with variations in geophone-array design are often subtle and difficult to discern through simple inspection of field records. By calculating frequency-dependent semblance, we were able to detect and quantify differences in array performance.",10.1190/1.2159055
"Constitutive Model And Wave Equations For Linear, Viscoelastic, Anisotropic Media","Rocks are far from being isotropic and elastic. Such simplifications in modeling the seismic response of real geological structures may lead to misinterpretations, or even worse, to overlooking useful information. It is useless to develop highly accurate modeling algorithms or to naively use amplitude information in inversion processes if the stress‐strain relations are based on simplified rheologies. Thus, an accurate description of wave propagation requires a rheology that accounts for the anisotropic and anelastic behavior of rocks. This work presents a new constitutive relation and the corresponding time‐domain wave equation to model wave propagation in inhomogeneous anisotropic and dissipative media. The rheological equation includes the generalized Hooke's law and Boltzmann's superposition principle to account for anelasticity. The attenuation properties in different directions, associated with the principal axes of the medium, are controlled by four relaxation functions of viscoelastic type. A dissipation model that is consistent with rock properties is the general standard linear solid. This is based on a spectrum of relaxation mechanisms and is suitable for wavefield calculations in the time domain. One relaxation function describes the anelastic properties of the quasi‐dilatational mode and the other three model the anelastic properties of the shear modes. The convolutional relations are avoided by introducing memory variables, six for each dissipation mechanism in the 3-D case, two for the generalized SH‐wave equation, and three for the qP − qSV wave equation. Two‐dimensional wave equations apply to monoclinic and higher symmetries. A plane analysis derives expressions for the phase velocity, slowness, attenuation factor, quality factor and energy velocity (wavefront) for homogeneous viscoelastic waves. The analysis shows that the directional properties of the attenuation strongly depend on the values of the elasticities. In addition, the displacement formulation of the 3-D wave equation is solved in the time domain by a spectral technique based on the Fourier method. The examples show simulations in a transversely‐isotropic clayshale and phenolic (orthorhombic symmetry).",10.1190/1.1443791
Magnetite Mapping With A Multicoil Airborne Electromagnetic System,"The information content of data from an in‐phase quadrature electromagnetic (EM) system consists of a combination of conductive eddy current response and magnetic polarization response. The secondary field resulting from conductive eddy current flow is frequency‐dependent and consists of both in‐phase and quadrature components of positive sign. Conversely, the field resulting from magnetic polarization is commonly frequency‐independent and consists of only an in‐phase component of negative sign. A magnetite mapping technique was developed for the horizontal coplanar coils of a closely coupled multicoil airborne EM system. The technique yields contours of apparent weight percent magnetite when using a homogeneous half‐space model. The method can be complementary to magnetometer mapping in certain cases. Compared to magnetometry, it is far less sensitive but is more able to resolve closely spaced magnetite zones. The method is also independent of remanent magnetism and magnetic latitude. It is sensitive to .25 percent magnetite by weight when the sensor is at a height of 30 m above a magnetitic half‐space. It can individually resolve steeply dipping narrow magnetite‐rich bands which are separated by 60 m.",10.1190/1.1441165
Experimental And Field Data For The Dual‐Frequency Phase‐Shift Method Of Airborne Electromagnetic Prospecting,"With the growing maturity in airborne electromagnetic instrumentation a transition has taken place from rule‐of‐thumb application and interpretation methods to a more sophisticated over‐all approach. A greatly improved success rate in the location of massive sulphide bodies is illustrated by recent results with the dual‐frequency phase‐shift airborne electromagnetic method. Part of the sophistication process has been the improvement of quantitative methods of interpretation, based on both theoretical and model studies. A recent research program has been most useful in this regard. These studies have been carried out within the framework of an active exploration department and have been integrated with field results at various stages.",10.1190/1.1438921
Salt Interpretation Enabled By Reverse-Time Migration,"Many production targets in greenfield exploration are found in salt provinces, which have highly complex structures as a result of salt formation over geologic time. Difficult geologic settings, steep dips, and other wave-propagation effects make reverse-time migration (RTM) the migration method of choice, rather than Kirchhoff migration or other (by definition approximate) one-way equation methods. Imaging of the subsurface using any depth-migration algorithm can be done successfully only when the quality of the prior velocity model is sufficient. The (velocity) model-building loop is an iterative procedure for improving the velocity model. This is done by obtaining certain measurements (residual moveout) on image gathers generated during the migration procedure; those measurements then are input into tomographic updating. Commonly RTM is applied around salt bodies, where building the velocity model fails essentially because tomography is ray-trace based. Our idea is to apply RTM directly inside the model-building loop but to do so without using the image gathers. Although the process is costly, we migrate the full frequency content of the data to create a high-quality stack. This enhances the interpretation of top and bottom salt significantly and enables us to include the resulting salt geometry in the velocity model properly. We demonstrate our idea on a 2D West Africa seismic line. After several model-building iterations, the result is a dramatically improved velocity model. With such a good model as input, the final RTM confirms the geometry of the salt bodies and basically the salt interpretation, and yields a compelling image of the subsurface.",10.1190/1.2968690

Geophysical History Of Typical Mississippi Piercement Salt Domes,"Maps and cross sections are given, showing the development of geophysical and geological knowledge of the New Home and D'Lo domes. Both are shallow, piercement domes in the northern part of the Mississippi salt dome basin. Both were first indicated by gravity surveys, the shallow cap‐rock checked by refraction seismograph surveys, cap‐rock depths checked by drilling and further seismograph work and drilling then carried out to determine the position of the salt and the attitude of the sediments. The successive items of geophysical work and test drilling have led to a consistent and orderly development of information about these domes. An additional note is included, with three pairs of gravity maps, showing how strong and definite, but very local, gravity expressions of shallow domes may be missed by reconnaissance surveys.",10.1190/1.1437293
"Occam'S Inversion To Generate Smooth, Two‐Dimensional Models From Magnetotelluric Data","Magnetotelluric (MT) data are inverted for smooth 2-D models using an extension of the existing 1-D algorithm, Occam's inversion. Since an MT data set consists of a finite number of imprecise data, an infinity of solutions to the inverse problem exists. Fitting field or synthetic electromagnetic data as closely as possible results in theoretical models with a maximum amount of roughness, or structure. However, by relaxing the misfit criterion only a small amount, models which are maximally smooth may be generated. Smooth models are less likely to result in overinterpretation of the data and reflect the true resolving power of the MT method. The models are composed of a large number of rectangular prisms, each having a constant conductivity. Apriori information, in the form of boundary locations only or both boundary locations and conductivity, may be included, providing a powerful tool for improving the resolving power of the data. Joint inversion of TE and TM synthetic data generated from known models allows comparison of smooth models with the true structure. In most cases, smoothed versions of the true structure may be recovered in 12–16 iterations. However, resistive features with a size comparable to depth of burial are poorly resolved. Real MT data present problems of non‐Gaussian data errors, the breakdown of the two‐dimensionality assumption and the large number of data in broadband soundings; nevertheless, real data can be inverted using the algorithm.",10.1190/1.1442813
Prospecting For Chromite With Gravimeter And Magnetometer Over Rugged Topography In East Turkey,"From 1952 to 1954 gravity and magnetic surveys were made in Turkey over the concessions of the Eastern Chromite Works to discover new chromite reserves in a region of rugged topography and complicated geology. As a result of these surveys a new chromite ore body of 250,000 tons was discovered at the bottom of an open cut beneath a thin horizontal sheet of chromite. It is shown that gravity prospecting is a more promising technique for locating relatively large chromite masses, even over rugged topography, than might have been expected. The terrain corrections, which constitute the major part of the computations, must be simplified and it is important that the correct surface densities be employed. In addition, difficulties arizing from the high and variable magnetic susceptibilities in serpentines must be surmounted. The mass of chromite estimated from the gravity results agrees well with the amount found by subsequent drilling.",10.1190/1.1438245
Multichannel Matching Pursuit For Seismic Trace Decomposition,"The technique of matching pursuit can adaptively decompose a seismic trace into a series of wavelets. However, the solution is not unique and is also strongly affected by data noise. Multichannel matching pursuit (MCMP), exploiting lateral coherence as a constraint, might improve the uniqueness of the solution. It extracts a constituent wavelet that has an optimal correlation coefficient to neighboring traces, instead of to a single trace only. According to linearity theory, a wavelet shared by neighboring traces is the best match to the average of multiple traces, and therefore it might effectively suppress the data noise and stabilize the performance. It is found that the MCMP scheme greatly improves spatial continuity in decomposition and can generate a plausible time-frequency spectrum with high resolution for reservoir detection.",10.1190/1.3462015
Methodology For Dense Spatial Sampling Of Multicomponent Recording Of Converted Waves In Shallow Marine Environments,"A widespread use of converted waves for shallow marine applications is hampered by spatial aliasing and field efficiency. Their short wavelengths require dense spatial sampling which often needs to be achieved by receivers deployed on the seabed. We adopted a new methodology where the dense spatial sampling is achieved in the common-receiver domain by reducing the shot spacing. This is done by shooting one track multiple times and merging the shot lines in an effective manner in a separate processing step. This processing step is essential because positioning errors introduced during the field measurement can become significant in the combined line, particularly when they exceed the distance between two adjacent shot positions. For this processing step, a particular shot line is used as a reference line and relative variations in source and receiver positions in the other shot lines are corrected for using crosscorrelation. The combined shot line can subsequently be regularized for further processing. The methodology is adopted in a field experiment conducted in the Danube River in Hungary. The aim of the seismic experiment was to acquire properly sampled converted-wave data using a multicomponent receiver array. The dense spatial sampling was achieved by sailing one track 14 times. After correcting for the underwater receiver positions using the direct arrival, the crosscorrelation step was applied to merge the different shot lines. The successfully combined result is regularized into a densely sampled data set free of visible spatial aliasing and suitable for converted-wave processing.",10.1190/1.3481362
Inversion Of Low-Induction Number Conductivity Meter Data To Predict Seasonal Saturation Variation,"Our research introduced a method to monitor saturation in the near surface. In agricultural settings, methods measuring electrical conductivity can provide useful information about soil type, moisture content, and salinity extent. Electrical conductivity meters have been used in a number of studies to determine soil properties in a qualitative sense. We examined the range of structures in which the use of low-induction number instruments can be used successfully to determine layered-earth electrical conductivity. We used an inversion routine which employs a Bayesian modification to the ridge-regression technique with a priori conductivity assumptions typical of agricultural areas. We performed joint inversion of horizontal and vertical dipole configurations at two coil separations for layer over half-space models with electrical properties of silt, loam, clay, and saline waters. Generally, the inversion code resolved layer thickness to better than 25% and electrical conductivity to better than 20% if the layer is less than 3-m thick. We then inverted field measurements acquired in salt-scalded areas in the Yass River Valley, New South Wales, Australia, to determine a layer over a half-space. With Kennedy's formulation concerning the relationship between porosity, water saturation and electrical conductivity, we used the field results to predict autumn water saturation for the top layer to be 13% and the bottom layer to be 15%. In the spring, we used the field results to predict saturation of 50% for the top layer and 51% for the bottom layer, leading to a seasonal variation in soil saturation of approximately 36%. Predicted saturation was spatially consistent across the traverse line, suggesting that the developed methodology was successful.",10.1190/geo2010-0378.1
Gravity Vertical Gradient Measurements For The Detection Of Small Geologic And Anthropogenic Forms,"The gravity tower vertical gradient has been applied to the solution of a number of important geologic, mining, and engineering problems, particularly to the search for and investigation of geologic structures and the detection of caverns and old mine workings. The effective application of the method depends upon recognizing the difference between the theoretical gravity vertical gradient Vzz and the gradient Wzz measured by means of a tower and gravimeter. The former is a derivative of the function g, the latter its differential quotient. Consequently, the differences between Vzz and Wzz in the same point may attain high values. Thus, e.g., for a sphere with a radius of 1 m, a density of 2.0 gm/cc and the depth of occurrence of its center equaling 1.2 m, the difference of the theoretical absolute amplitudes Avzz-Awzz=465.4 Eötvös units. Application of the method of the gravity tower vertical gradient on an industrial scale was possible due to the introduction of (1) a new design of the measuring tower, (2) detailed analysis of errors, and (3) a new method of calculating the topographic correction of the gravity vertical gradient. The paper sums up the results of five years of research work and industrial applications. During that period several thousand measurements of the gravity vertical gradient were made.",10.1190/1.1440657
The Numerical Computation Of Cagniard'S Integrals,"The numerical calculations may be made in such a manner as to make clear the influence of various factors on the results. This is done for the buried source and receiver in a semi‐infinite elastic medium. The process is to alter the path of integration so that with increasing time one increases the integration path length. Thus the total field unfolds as we carry out the integration. The work is done graphically. The path is mapped by an electrolytic tank technique suitably modified from that used by electric network synthesis workers. The integrand is separated into a product of two terms, one independent of time and position and one dependent on time and position. The independent term can be mapped on a conducting sheet for one Poisson ratio. The dependent term may be mapped for each time and position. A function multiplier and integrator are needed. The method is most accurate when the horizontal distance of the receiver is not very large compared with the sum of the depths of the source and receiver. The method is alterable to include the domain of difficult direct application. Every aspect of the methods herein described may be extended in the practical sense to the more general case treated by Cagniard. This is, in fact, the main justification for this study of an old problem.",10.1190/1.1438459
Fast 2D Inversion Of Large Borehole Em Induction Data Sets With An Efficient Fréchet-Derivative Approximation,"In addition to reliability and stability, the efficiency and expediency of inversion methods have long been a strong concern for their routine applications by well-log interpreters. We have developed and successfully validated a new inversion method to estimate 2D parametric spatial distributions of electrical resistivity from array-induction measurements acquired in a vertical well. The central component of the method is an efficient approximation to Fréchet derivatives where both the incident and adjoint fields are precomputed and kept unchanged during inversion. To further enhance the overall efficiency of the inversion, we combined the new approximation with both the improved numerical mode-matching method and domain decomposition. Examples of application with synthetic data sets show that the new methodis computer efficient and capable of retrieving original model re-sistivities even in the presence of noise, performing equally well in both high and low contrasts of formation resistivity. In thin resistive beds, the new inversion method estimates more accurate resistivities than standard commercial deconvolution software. We also considered examples of application with field data sets that confirm the new method can successfully process a large data set that includes 200 beds in approximately   40 minutes   of CPU time on a desktop computer. In addition to 2D parametric spatial distributions of electrical resistivity, the new inversion method provides a qualitative indicator of the uncertainty of estimated parameters based on the estimator's covariance matrix. The uncertainty estimator provides a qualitative measure of the nonuniqueness of estimated resistivity parameters when the data misfit lies within the measurement error (noise).",10.1190/1.3033213
The Present State Of Geothermal Investigations,"At present, the emphasis in geothermal studies in non‐volcanic areas is on the flow of heat to the surface, a quantity of much theoretical importance. The number of reliable determinations of heat flow is still small, with few of the oil‐producing regions represented. While thermal gradients range from about 5 to 70°C/km, most of the measurements of heat flow fall within the range 1.2⋅10-6cal/cm2‐sec±50%, including the recent values for the deep ocean basins. There are suggestions of regional variations, but many more measurements reliable to 10% or better will be needed for further progress. The study of regions or provinces, rather than single localities, is especially desirable, and should be feasible in areas extensively drilled for oil. The principal requirements, which are difficult to meet, are: 1) approximate thermal equilibrium, which may require an undisturbed period of many months, and 2) availability for laboratory study of cores representing the major formations penetrated by the well. A renewal of interest in this subject among oil geologists, with recognition and exploitation of opportunities as they arise, could greatly advance its development.",10.1190/1.1438034
Seismic‐While‐Drilling By Using Tunnel Boring Machine Noise,"The tunnel boring machine (TBM) is used extensively to mechanically excavate tunnels. To optimize the mechanical drilling and work safely, an estimate of the geology to be drilled is necessary. We consider using the elastic waves produced by the TBM cutting wheel to obtain seismic‐while‐drilling (SWD) information for predicting the geology ahead of the drilling front. This method uses accelerometers mounted on the TBM together with geophones located along and outside the tunnel, similar to the technique successfully used to drill oil and geothermal wells. Study of noise and the resolution of the signal produced by the large‐diameter cutting head shows that nonstationary noise separation can be achieved by locating sensors at the front and rear ends of the tunnel. The (higher) resolution in front of the TBM is limited by pilot delays, while the (lower) lateral resolution is limited by the radial dimension of the TBM. Analysis of seismic data acquired in a field test shows that P‐ and S‐wave arrivals have a wide frequency band and high amplitude in seismic traces measured 700 m away from the drilling front. In comparison with SWD applications in wells, tunnel SWD technology has the advantage of allowing direct access to the tunnel front, which makes it easy to connect the TBM reference sensors for while‐drilling monitoring. This method can be successfully applied without interfering with drilling activity to monitor tunnel excavation continuously, reduce risks, and optimize drilling.",10.1190/1.1527080
"Attributes Of The Magnetic Field, Analytic Signal, And Monogenic Signal For Gravity And Magnetic Interpretation","Many of the transforms and attributes used in gravity and magnetic interpretation can be expressed as a 2D or 3D vector. The horizontal gradient and the 2D analytic signal are 2D vectors. The gravity or magnetic field, the 3D analytic signal, and the monogenic signal are defined by a 3D vector. In practice, we prefer to interpret the amplitude and/or phase of a 2D or 3D vector, but we often forget that a meaningful interpretation requires a magnetic reduction-to-the-pole operation when these techniques are applied to magnetic anomaly data and the source body is 3D. Furthermore, the gravity or magnetic anomaly has an unknown constant level that may affect the amplitude and phase. The horizontal gradient, the analytic signal, and the monogenic signal can be applied to not only the gravity or magnetic anomaly but also any nth-order derivative or a filtered version of the anomaly. They can be related to each other and to the magnetic field vector. We do not introduce new attributes. Instead, we have explained the relationships among different transforms (or vectors) and addressed precautions and requirements for their practical use.",10.1190/geo2015-0697.1
Multichannel Analysis Of Love Waves In A 3D Seismic Acquisition System,"Multichannel analysis of Love waves (MALW) analyzes high-frequency Love waves to determine near-surface S-wave velocities, and it is getting increasing attention in the near-surface geophysics and geotechnique community. Based on 2D geometry spread, in which sources and receivers are placed along the same line, current MALW fails to work in a 3D seismic acquisition system. This is because Love-wave particle motion direction is perpendicular to its propagation direction, which makes it difficult to record a Love-wave signal in 3D geometries. We have developed a method to perform MALW with data acquired in 3D geometry. We recorded two orthogonal horizontal components (inline and crossline components) at each receiver point at the same time. By transforming the raw data from rectangular coordinates (inline and crossline components) to radial-transverse coordinates (radial and transverse components), we recovered Love-wave data along the transverse direction at each receiver point. To achieve a Love-wave dispersion curve, the recovered Love-wave data were first transformed into a conventional receiver offset domain, and then transformed into the frequency-velocity (f-v) domain. Love-wave dispersion curves were picked along the continuous dispersive energy peaks in the f-v domain. The validity of our proposed method was verified by two synthetic tests and a real-world example.",10.1190/geo2015-0261.1
Hysteresis In The Velocity‐Pressure Characteristics Of Rocks,"It is shown that in dry sedimentary rock the velocity of elastic waves depends not only on the present values of the internal and external pressures but also on the past pressure history of the sample. The internal and external pressures are shown to be equally effective in changing velocities, provided the pressure differential follows a pressure cycle previously impressed upon the sample.",10.1190/1.1439524
Analysis Of Total Magnetic‐Intensity Anomalies Produced By Point And Line Sources,"The component of total magnetic intensity in the direction of the earth's total field, the quantity measured by the airborne magnetometer, is studied in relation to point‐pole and line‐of‐poles sources. Theoretical profiles are examined for maxima and minima, and it is established that the depth is a linear function of the half‐maximum abscissa. A family of curves is presented by means of which factors can be obtained for use in estimating depths. The well‐known factors used with vertical intensity profiles are included as a special case. An example is given in which the factors are used in analyzing a theoretical anomaly.",10.1190/1.1437414
Electric Logging Applied To Ground‐Water Exploration,"A method is described for the determination of the quality of ground water in granular aquifers penetrated by rotary‐drilled holes electrically logged. Conventional techniques of electric‐log interpretation, to determine true bed resistivity from apparent resistivity values, are briefly described; and a method for converting water‐resistivity values into hypothetical chemical analyses is explained. The objective of the method is to narrow the limits of error in quality‐of‐water estimates based upon electric logs. Water‐well contractors are fully aware of the risks attendant in making drill‐stem tests in open hole, which is the method now employed to obtain representative samples of formation water. Packer failure results in contaminated samples; hole collapse may mean loss of drill stem, screen, and the hole. In the Gulf Coast where water‐well tests range in depth from 100 to 3,000 feet, methods that will eliminate at least a part of the need for drill‐stem tests deserve consideration. The paper deals also with methods of determining formation porosity in situ, which is an important factor in salt‐water‐encroachment problems.",10.1190/1.1437640
International Gravity Bureau (I.G.B.),"The usefulness of a world center for the collection and storage of gravity data is obvious to geophysicists and geodesists. The readers of our journal will be interested to read about the International Gravity Bureau (of the International Association of Geodesy) in Paris, whose mission is to assemble gravity data and integrate them into the world gravity net. In response to a request by Dr. L. L. Nettleton, Professor P. Tardi, Director of the Bureau, was kind enough to contribute a brief description of the Bureau and its activities for publication in Geophysics.",10.1190/1.1439604
A New Computerized Method For Finding Effective Velocity From Reversed Reflection Traveltime Data,"A new computerized method is developed using a pair of direct and reversed reflection traveltime curves from two reciprocal shotpoints for finding effective velocity (Veff) appropriate to the depth of the common‐reflection‐point (CRP) for a dipping reflector. For the two sets of traveltime data, least‐square fits are made to T2 versus (X2+4Xdsinθ), where T is the traveltime for recording distance X, θ is the dip of the reflector, and d is the perpendicular distance from the shotpoint to the reflector. The observed convergence of d for any assumed reflector dip θ makes it possible to scan through a wide range of θ values by an iterative process until the velocities computed by the direct and reversed traveltime data agree within the required tolerance limit, which then yields the appropriate effective velocity, and the corresponding θ is the true dip of the reflector. This method simultaneously yields an optimum migrated depth cross‐section. It is also possible to study, by this method, velocity distribution in both vertical and lateral directions in the subsurface area under investigation.",10.1190/1.1440995
Interpolation Of Near Offsets Using Multiples And Prediction-Error Filters,"Reflection seismic data typically are undersampled. Missing near offsets can be interpolated in reflection seismic data with pseudoprimaries, generated by crosscorrelating multiples and primaries in incomplete recorded data. These pseudoprimary data can be generated at the missing near offsets but contain many artifacts, so it is undesirable simply to replace the missing data with the pseudoprimaries. A nonstationary prediction-error filter (PEF) can instead be estimated from the pseudoprimaries and used to interpolate missing data to produce an interpolated output that is superior to direct substitution of the pseudoprimaries into the missing offsets. This approach is applied successfully to 2D synthetic and field data. Limitations in conventional acquisition geometry limit this approach in 3D, which can be illustrated using a synthetic data set.",10.1190/1.3506557
Automatic First-Breaks Picking: New Strategies And Algorithms,"We have developed three methods for the automatic picking of first breaks that can be used for marine, dynamite, or vibroseis shot records: a modified Coppens's method, an entropy-based method, and a variogram fractal-dimension method. The techniques are based on the fact that the transition between noise and noise plus signal can be automatically identified by detecting rapid changes in a certain attribute (energy ratio, entropy, or fractal dimension), which we calculate within moving windows along the seismic trace. The application of appropriate edge-preserving smoothing operators to enhance these transitions allowed us to develop an automated strategy that can be used to easily signal the precise location of the first-arrival onset. Furthermore, we propose a mispick-correcting technique to exploit the benefits of the data present in the entire shot record, which allows us to adjust the trace-by-trace picks and to discard picks associated with bad or dead traces. As a result, the consistency of the first-break picks is significantly improved. The methods are robust under noisy conditions, computationally efficient, and easy to apply. Results using dynamite and vibroseis field data show that accurate and consistent picks can be obtained in an automated manner even under the presence of correlated noise, bad traces, pulse changes, and indistinct first breaks.",10.1190/1.3463703
A Hybrid Three‐Dimensional Electromagnetic Modeling Scheme,"We present an efficient numerical method for computing electromagnetic (EM) scattering of arbitrary three‐dimensional (3-D) local inhomogeneities buried in a uniform or two‐layered earth. In this scheme the inhomogeneity is enclosed by a volume whose conductivity is discretized by a finite‐element mesh and whose boundary is only a slight distance away from the inhomogeneity. The scheme uses two sets of independent equations. The first is a set of finite‐element equations derived from a variational integral, and the second is a mathematical expression for the fields at the boundany in terms of electric fields inside the boundary. The Green's function is used to derive the second set of equations. An iterative algorithm has been developed to solve these two sets of equations. The solutions are the electric fields at nodes inside the finite‐element mesh. The scattered fields anywhere may then be obtained by performing volume integrations over the inhomogeneous region. The scheme is used for modeling 3-D inhomogeneities with plane‐wave and magnetic dipole sources. The results agree with earlier model analyses using the finite‐element technique.",10.1190/1.1441216
Effect Of Pore Geometry And Dissolved C O2 On Ultrasonic Transmission During Pore Pressure Changes,"It is common practice to use changes in fluid transmission velocity to determine whether a fluid is in gas or liquid phase during pore pressure changes, but transmission amplitude also changes when fluid phase changes during pore pressure reduction. We used two sizes of glass beads in a low-pressure cell to simulate porous rock and conducted experiments with pore spaces filled with distilled water, and with distilled water in which   0.3 mol   of   C O2    was dissolved. Ultrasonic transmission tests above and below bubble point showed that transmission frequencies and amplitudes were higher for distilled water and the smaller beads. There was a greater reduction in frequencies and amplitudes when gas was liberated by scattering from the small gas bubbles associated with the small beads. The water-  C O2    mixture produced higher transmission amplitudes than distilled wateralone, which is consistent with increasing fluid density in the pores. Although Henry's law was appropriate for predicting the onset of bubbles, the ultrasonic response sensed bubble nucleation before the pressure predicted by Henry's law was reached. We also found that transmission amplitudes and frequencies changed more quickly than transmission velocity, which changed little by comparison. Our study suggests that for time-lapse monitoring of   C O2    sequestration operations, changes of transmission amplitude and frequency may provide a quantitative assessment of the amount of dissolved   C O2    in connate water. Observations of ultrasonic transmission amplitude and frequency are more important in this regard than velocity observations. This knowledge can be applied where   C O2    migrates or changes phase after sequestration, be it at depth, or as a result of near-surface leakage. Walk-away VSP data can provide a suitable monitoring tool for this purpose.",10.1190/1.2978165
Ultrasonic Propagation In Solenhofen Limestone At High Pressures,"The measurement of ultrasonic velocities at high pressure in minerals and rocks provides information pertinent to a variety of geophysical and engineering problems such as those of determining the state of matter in the earth's interior, understanding the propagation of seismic waves, and characterizing mechanical behavior of materials that are important in mining technology. In recent years there have been a number of reported high pressure sound velocity measurements in various kinds of limestone.  (A concise review of this work can be found in a recent paper by Singh and Kennedy, 1974.) Such measurements continue to be of interest because of the relationship to shock‐wave propagation properties (Grady et al, 1977). From the previous measurements it has been found that the phase transitions in calcite, which is the main constituent of limestone, strongly influence the sound velocities. The phase transitions in pure calcite occur at 14.5 kbar (calcite I–II) and 17.4 kbar (calcite II–III) (Singh and Kennedy, 1974); however, because the transitions may be shifted in pressure and spread out over a range of pressures in a rock, it is necessary to make measurements to pressures in excess of 20 kbar in order to characterize the effects of the transitions. To date there has been only one experimental study of the effect of the II–III transition on sound propagation, namely the longitudinal wave measurements in Oak Hall limestone made by Wang and Meltzer (1973). In order to further characterize the effect of the II–III transition on sound propagation in limestone, we have made measurements to 25 kbar on Solenhofen limestone. We were able to measure both longitudinal and transverse velocities over the  full pressure range; thus, our measurements represent the first study of the effect of the II–III transition on shear wave propagation under conditions of hydro static pressure.",10.1190/1.1440863
The Characteristics Of Reflection Traveltimes For Some Layer Models,"The characteristics of reflection time‐distance curves were examined mainly in terms of stacking velocity for various single‐layer models. There were basically different types: 1-D stratified layer, 2-D stratified plane dipping layer, and 2-D homogeneous curved layer. It is shown through numerical experiments that a highly stratified medium can lead to a large error in the estimates of the layer thickness if the stratification effect is ignored. This error can be reduced in part by approximating the medium with an elliptically anisotropic one. In the homogeneous but curved layer case, the conventional stacking velocity analysis yields an increased bias in velocity with increasing curvature of the reflecting interface and with increasing local dip of the interface at the normal incidence point. Unless this bias is corrected, the common Dix‐type velocity estimation technique can lead to a significant error in the depth estimates.",10.1190/1.1441642
Complex Seismic Trace Analysis Of Thin Beds,"Displays of complex trace attributes can help to define thin beds in seismic sections. If the wavelet in a section is zero phase, low impedance strata whose thicknesses are of the order of half the peak‐to‐peak period of the dominant seismic energy show up as anomalously high‐amplitude zones on instantaneous amplitude sections. These anomalies result from the well‐known amplitude tuning effect which occurs when reflection coefficients of opposite polarity a half period apart are convolved with a seismic wavelet. As the layers thin to a quarter period of the dominant seismic energy, thinning is revealed by an anomalous increase in instantaneous frequency. This behavior results from the less well‐known but equally important phenomenon of frequency tuning by beds which thin laterally. Instantaneous frequency reaches an anomalously high value when bed thickness is about a quarter period and remains high as the bed continues to thin. In this paper, complex trace analysis is applied to a synthetic model of a wedge and to a set of broadband field data acquired to delineate thin lenses of porous sandstone. The two case studies illustrate that sets of attribute displays can be used to verify the presence and dimensions of thin beds when definition of the beds is not obvious on conventional seismic sections.",10.1190/1.1441670
Electromagnetic Fields Of Electric Dipoles Embedded In A Stratified Anisotropic Earth,"The anisotropy of electrical conductivity in earth formations may be caused by crystal anisotropies of minerals, as well as by minilayers which occur frequently in sedimentary environments. The effects of anisotropy on the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) fields have been studied by many geophysicists. For instance, Kong (1972) and Wait (1981) solved the EM propagation problem for vertically anisotropic layered earths; O'Brien and Morrison (1967), for a horizontally anisotropic multilayer half‐space; Chetayev (1960), as well as Reddy and Rankin (1971), for media of dipping anisotropies; and Al'tgauzen (1969), for more complicated anisotropic media with a tensor dielectric constant of five components.",10.1190/1.1442633
Synthesis Of A Layered Medium From Its Acoustic Transmission Response,A direct (noniterative) method is presented to determine an acoustic layered medium from the seismogram due to a time‐limited plane wave incident from the lower halfspace. It is shown that one side of the autocorrelation of the seismogram due to an impulsive source at depth is the seismogram due to an impulsive source on the surface. This transforms the problem to the acoustic reflections problem as solved by Kunetz. Both the deep source time function and the layering can be determined from a surface seismogram.,10.1190/1.1439927
The Temperature Stabilization Of A Borehole,"Analytic solutions for the temperature stabilization of both square and circular boreholes are considered. It is found that a previously published solution for a square borehole is incorrect in that it does not reproduce the initially assumed conditions. The correct analytic solution for a square well, as well as that for a circular well, indicates a much more rapid approach to the formation temperature. The temperature stabilization curves for a range of thermal diffusivity values are given.",10.1190/1.1441268
Theory Of True-Amplitude One-Way Wave Equations And True-Amplitude Common-Shot Migration,"One-way wave operators are powerful tools for forward modeling and migration. Here, we describe a recently developed true-amplitude implementation of modified one-way operators and present some numerical examples. By ""true-amplitude"" one-way forward modeling we mean that the solutions are dynamically correct as well as kinematically correct. That is, ray theory applied to these equations yields the upward- and downward-traveling eikonal equations of the full wave equation, and the amplitude satisfies the transport equation of the full wave equation. The solutions of these equations are used in the standard wave-equation migration imaging condition. The boundary data for the downgoing wave is also modified from the one used in the classic theory because the latter data is not consistent with a point source for the full wave equation. When the full wave-form solutions are replaced by their ray-theoretic approximations, the imaging formula reduces to the common-shot Kirchhoff inversion formula. In this sense, the migration is true amplitude as well. On the other hand, this new method retains all of the fidelity features of wave equation migration. Computer output using numerically generated data confirms the accuracy of this inversion method. However, there are practical limitations. The observed data must be a solution of the wave equation. Therefore, the data must be collected from a single common-shot experiment. Multiexperiment data, such as common-offset data, cannot be used with this method as presently formulated.",10.1190/1.1988182
Spectral Analysis Of Gravity And Magnetic Anomalies Due To Two‐Dimensional Structures,"The expressions for the spectra of both gravity and magnetic anomalies due to a two‐dimensional structure consist of (except for a factor) sums of exponentials. The exponents of these exponentials are functions of frequency and the locations of the corners of the polygonal cross‐section of the structure. Two computationally feasible methods for determining the exponents from a given spectrum are described in this paper; they are essentially based on the generation of a system of linear equations. The unknown coefficients in this system of equations are functions of the corner locations. The first method requires expansion of the exponentials in the expressions for the spectra in the form of a series and works reliably when the amplitudes of low frequencies are analyzed. The unknown parameters are determined fairly accurately with this method by suitable combinations of the spectra of the observed anomaly and its moments. The second method utilizes an exponential approximation technique for producing the system of linear equations. If only the spectrum of the anomaly is used, the system of equations becomes ill‐conditioned in most cases resulting in grossly inaccurate solutions. However, particular combinations of the spectra of the anomaly and its first and second order moments are found to improve significantly the behavior of the system of equations and thus the quality of results. It has also been found that the mean values of corner locations can be calculated fairly accurately by taking the ratios of the spectra of the anomaly and its moments. Once the corner locations are found, computation of the density contrast in the case of a gravity anomaly and the magnetization contrast for a magnetic anomaly is straightforward.",10.1190/1.1440593
A Theory Of Compressional Wave Attenuation In Noncohesive Sediments,"Published reviews indicate that attenuation coefficients of compressional waves in noncohesive, water‐saturated sediments vary linearly with frequency. Biot's theory, which accounts for attenuation in terms of the viscous interaction between the solid particles and pore fluid, predicts in its presently published form variation proportional to f2 at low frequencies and f1/2 at high frequencies. A modification of Biot's theory which incorporates a distribution of pore sizes is presented and shown to give excellent agreement with new and published attenuation data in the frequency range 10 kHz to 2.25 MHz. In particular, a linear variation of attenuation with frequency is predicted in that range.",10.1190/1.1442002
Geophysical Operations In The North Sea,"During the last three years the discovery of the world's second largest natural gas field at Groningen in the Netherlands has touched off in the North Sea one of the greatest competitive offshore geophysical operations in history. Before 1962, only minor amounts of geophysical work had been done there. Severe weather conditions were expected, but seismic operations have not been as much affected by weather as was originally anticipated. However, strong currents, making cable location uncertain, hampered reflection stacking and refraction operations. Location by radio was also a serious problem due to lack of sufficient available frequencies for a lane identification system. Seismic work was carried out safely in areas mapped as mine fields. Few problems with the fishing industry have so far been encountered. As a preliminary, the geophysics of the Groningen area are discussed. A gravity compilation of the North Sea shows that there are three major basins—the Northwest German Zechstein Basin, the British North Sea Basin, and the Norwegian North Sea Basin. The British Basin which contains Tertiary, Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, Carboniferous, and older sediments shows considerable salt movement with salt domes, walls, and pillows being in evidence to within 30 miles of the eastern coast of England. Some examples of seismic record sections show the quality of data and the kind of structures encountered. Water reverberations were satisfactorily reduced by means of anti‐ringing procedures. Multiple reflections were frequently observed and often interfered with or obscured simple reflections. Refraction studies indicate that two main refractors, the Upper Cretaceous Chalk and the Upper Magnesian Limestone of the Permian, are present over most of the British Basin. Mapping the key basal Permian reflector is made difficult by deterioration of the reflection under areas of salt growth. Stacking sometimes enhances this reflection. Also intrusions of Permian salt into the Mesozoic beds give rise to large and rapid changes in thickness of the overlying low‐velocity Tertiary and high‐velocity Cretaceous chalk sections. A correction system for these large lateral velocity changes is described.",10.1190/1.1439614
Three‐Dimensional Gravity Inversion Using Simulated Annealing: Constraints On The Diapiric Roots Of Allochthonous Salt Structures,"In the northern continental slope of the Gulf of Mexico, large oil and gas reservoirs are often found beneath sheetlike, allochthonous salt structures that are laterally extensive. Some of these salt structures retain their diapiric feeders or roots beneath them. These hidden roots are difficult to image seismically. In this study, we develop a method to locate and constrain the geometry of such roots through 3‐D inverse modeling of the gravity anomalies observed over the salt structures. This inversion method utilizes a priori information such as the upper surface topography of the salt, which can be delineated by a limited coverage of 2‐D seismic data; the sediment compaction curve in the region; and the continuity of the salt body. The inversion computation is based on the simulated annealing (SA) global optimization algorithm. The SA‐based gravity inversion has some advantages over the approach based on damped least‐squares inversion. It is computationally efficient, can solve underdetermined inverse problems, can more easily implement complex a priori information, and does not introduce smoothing effects in the final density structure model. We test this inversion method using synthetic gravity data for a type of salt geometry that is common among the allochthonous salt structures in the Gulf of Mexico and show that it is highly effective in constraining the diapiric root. We also show that carrying out multiple inversion runs helps reduce the uncertainty in the final density model.",10.1190/1.1487089
A Critique Of Seismic Deconvolution Methods,"Different seismic pulse compression methods are evaluated. These include several algorithms for computing prediction error filters: Wiener filtering, Burg's method, the ℓ1 norm criterion, Kalman filtering, and two time‐adaptive methods. Algorithms which do not assume a minimum‐phase condition for the seismic wavelet include minimum entropy, homomorphic, and zero‐phase deconvolution. The sensitivity of these algorithms is examined for various earth reflectivity functions, source waveforms, and signal distortions. The results indicate that standard Wiener predictive deconvolution is robust under a wide variety of input conditions. However, a substantial improvement in pulse compression can be obtained by the Burg algorithm under conditions of short data segments and by minimum entropy deconvolution for seismograms consisting of mixed‐phase wavelets combined with sparse reflectivity series.",10.1190/1.1441627
Reconnaissance Survey Using Average Horizontal Gradients Of Gravity,"Some time ago, Romberg (1956/57) pointed out the advantage of reading horizontal gravity gradients rather than vertical gradients with the gravity meter. Several years later, in March, 1960, an experimental profile of gravity‐meter‐determined horizontal gradients was run for the author in the South Houston field by courtesy of Texas Instruments Incorporated. Since then, this gradient technique was repeatedly discussed but only very few results could be published (Thyssen‐Bornemisza et al., 1960, 1962a, 1962b). Stackler (1963) more recently pointed out again the value of the average gravity gradient for reconnaissance surveys predominantly in inaccessible areas.",10.1190/1.1439638
Reflection Waveform Inversion Of Ground-Penetrating Radar Data For Characterizing Thin And Ultrathin Layers Of Nonaqueous Phase Liquid Contaminants In Stratified Media,"Accurately quantifying thin-layer parameters by applying a targeted reflection waveform inversion methodology to ground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection data may provide a useful tool for near-surface investigation and especially for contaminated site investigation where nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants are present. We implemented a targeted reflection waveform inversion algorithm to quantify thin-layer permittivity, thickness, and conductivity for NAPL thin (≤1/2 dominant wavelength λ) and ultrathin (≤1/8λ) layers using GPR reflection data. The inversion used a nonlinear grid search with a Monte Carlo scheme to initialize starting values to find the global minimum. By taking a targeted approach using a time window around the peak amplitude of the reflection event of interest, our algorithm reduced the complexity in the inverse problem. We tested the inversion on three different synthetic data sets and four field data sets. In all testing, the inversion solved for NAPL-layer properties within 15% of the measured values. This algorithm provides a tool for site managers to prioritize remediation efforts based on quantitative assessments of contaminant quantity and location using GPR.",10.1190/geo2014-0037.1
The Method Of Generalized Reflection And Transmission Coefficients,"The objective of this work is to provide a method for predicting the surface response of a stratified half space to the radiation from a localized source when neither the assumptions of the plane wave theory nor the assumptions of the normal mode theory are valid. The earth model consists of a finite number of perfectly elastic, homogeneous, isotropic layers separated by interfaces which are plane and parallel to one another. The method leads to an infinite series for the Laplace transform of the response function (displacement, velocity, stress, etc.) in a multi‐interface system. Each term in the series describes all the energy which traverses a particular generalized ray path between the source and the receiver. The specification of the mode of propagation across each stratum (either as an irrotational wave or as an equivoluminal wave) and of the sequence in which the strata are traversed serve to define a generalized ray path. A prescription is given for constructing the integral representation for the disturbance which has traversed such a path directly from the integral representation for the source radiation. The method therefore obviates the necessity for solving a tedious boundary value problem. The time function associated with each term can be obtained by using Cagniard's method.",10.1190/1.1438743
Automated Stratigraphic Interpretation Of Well‐Log Data,"A computerized well‐log stratigraphic interpretation system based on artificial intelligence can be seen as two steps, contact recognition and interval identification. Unlike previous approaches to mathematical zonation which are essentially statistical, consideration of the geologic environment is included for effective interpretation. Following the logic of human experts, the system first determines the log signature of the contacts. An algorithm incorporating linear regression with variable breakpoints is used to describe the structure of log curves. Log features are mapped to the assigned signature of contacts. Multiple logs are taken into account to set up the final set of contacts, which divides the test borehole into a string of intervals with attributes. A pattern string of intervals is based on the integrated geologic column for the section where the borehole is located. A string‐to‐string matching program then determines the optimal map of the test borehole as the pattern to generate a geologic column based on the computer suggestion. The cost formulas for matching represent knowledge about the stratigraphy of the area under study, and the string‐to‐string matching algorithm includes this knowledge of stratigraphy. In test boreholes in an oil‐sand deposit, 86 percent of the computer identifications of intervals were consistent with those determined by geologists from core descriptions, suggesting that the design concept and computer algorithm are consistent with the characteristics of the interpretation problem.",10.1190/1.1442283
Validity Of The Acoustic Approximation For Elastic Waves In Heterogeneous Media,"The acoustic approximation of elastic waves is a very common approximation in exploration geophysics. The interest of the acoustic approximation in the inverse problem context lies in the fact that it leads to a much lower numerical cost than for the elastic problem. Nevertheless, the earth is not an acoustic body, and it has been found in the past that this approximation is not without drawbacks mainly because of P-to-S energy conversion and that anisotropy cannot be easily modeled. We studied a different issue of this approximation related to small heterogeneities with respect to the minimum wavelength of the wavefield. We first numerically found that elastic and acoustic waves behave differently with respect to small-scale heterogeneities, introducing differences in amplitudes but also in phase between elastic and acoustic signals. We then derived physical and mathematical interpretations of this phenomenon, developing the different nature of elastic- and acoustic-wave propagation that led to the conclusion that, in rough media, acoustic waves can only be a poor-quality approximation of elastic waves. Interestingly, we also found that, in the acoustic case, small-scale heterogeneities give rise to natural acoustic effective anisotropic media through an anisotropic effective mass matrix. Unfortunately, this anisotropy is of a different nature compared with the elastic effective anisotropy and can not be used to mimic elastic anisotropy.",10.1190/geo2014-0397.1
Denoising Multicomponent Csem Data With Equivalent Source Processing Techniques,"Frequency-domain controlled-source electromagnetic surveys can be negatively affected by near-surface geologic features, resulting in static shifts in the observed electric field amplitude data. We propose using an equivalent source method to denoise electric field data from frequency-domain controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys. The equivalent source method can either be applied individually to data from each measured frequency or simultaneously to data from all frequencies measured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by denoising an individual synthetic CSEM survey with data contaminated with noise from near-surface conductive bodies, as well as a synthetic time-lapse survey representing resistivity changes in a target due to, for instance, CO2 sequestration. We also apply the equivalent source method to denoise a set of controlled-source audio-magnetotelluric data affected by static shift from a field survey in western China.",10.1190/geo2012-0226.1
U.S. National Magnetic Anomaly Survey Specifications Workshop Report,"The National Magnetic Anomaly Map (NMAM) Committee, which was formed as an ad hoc committee in 1975 by the SEG Executive Committee, has recommended a multistage program for improving the aeromagnetic data of the U.S. On behalf of the geoscience community, the committee and the U.S. Geological Survey are currently engaged in the preparation of a photo‐composite map of the U.S. derived from publicly available data plus regional magnetic data contributed from the private sector. This map is at present being compiled and is to be pulished by the U.S.G.S. at a scale of 1:2.5×106. Eventually, utilizing this map, the committee plans to assist in the preparation of a North American magnetic anomaly map to supplement the North American tectonic map and the proposed continental gravity anomaly map.",10.1190/1.1440991
On Numerically Solving The Complex Eikonal Equation Using Real Ray-Tracing Methods: A Comparison With The Exact Analytical Solution,"The exact analytical solution of the complex eikonal equation describing P- and S-waves radiated by a point source situated in a simple type of isotropic viscoelastic medium was ascertained. The velocity-attenuation model is smoothly inhomogeneous with a constant gradient of the square of the complex slowness. The resultant traveltime is complex; its real part describes the wave propagation and its imaginary part describes the attenuation effects. The solution was further used as a reference solution for numerical tests of the accuracy and robustness of two approximate ray-tracing approaches solving the complex eikonal equation: real elastic ray tracing and real viscoelastic ray tracing. Numerical modeling revealed that the real viscoelastic ray tracing method is unequivocally preferable to elastic ray tracing. It is more accurate and works even in situations when the elastic ray tracing fails. Also, the ray fields calculated by the real viscoelastic ray tracing are excellently reproduced even in the case when the elastic ray tracing yields completely distorted results. Compared with complex ray tracing, which is limited to simple types of media, the real viscoelastic ray tracing offers a fast and computationally straightforward procedure for calculating complex traveltimes in complicated 3D inhomogeneous attenuating structures.",10.1190/geo2011-0431.1
Another Optimization Trick For The Multiple-Attenuation Method: Multishooting Processing Of Single-Shot Data,"We consider marine seismic data collected in a standard shot-gather form, i.e., seismic waves generated from one single-source location at a time. We propose to group these data as if they were acquired with a multishooting technique (to simulate seismic waves generated from several shot locations simultaneously) and then to demultiple them as multishot data. By doing so, we reduce the size of our data and processing time several fold.",10.1190/1.3125875
"Modulus—Porosity Relations, Gassmann'S Equations, And The Low‐Frequency Elastic‐Wave Response To Fluids","Gassmann's equations relate the low‐frequency drained and undrained elastic‐wave response to fluids. This tutorial explores how different modulus—porosity relationships affect predictions of the low‐frequency elastic‐wave response to fluids based on Gassmann's equations. I take different modulus—porosity relations and substitute them into Gassmann's equations through the framework moduli. The results illustrate the range of responses to fluids and can be summarized in a nomograph of the effective fluid coefficient, which quantifies the change in the pore‐space modulus (∂Kpore/Kpore) in response to a change in fluid modulus (∂Kfluid/Kfluid). Two ratios control the effective fluid coefficient: the ratio of the fluid modulus to the solid‐grain modulus ( Kfluid/Ksolid) and the ratio of the Biot coefficient to porosity (αK/ϕ). The effective fluid coefficient nomograph is a convenient tool for estimating how low‐frequency elastic‐wave properties will respond to changes in reservoir fluids.",10.1190/1.1444826
Topographic And Terrain Correction For Airborne Gravity,"A simple, convenient procedure is outlined for evaluating topographic and terrain effects in airborne gravimetry. The method assumes that continuous terrain data (flight elevation and terrain clearance) are available along a traverse. The terrain is taken to be uniform to infinity in both directions perpendicular to the flight line. The correction is easily calculated from a simple product series. The error tolerances are not serious. Nonperpendicular, irregular topography cannot be evaluated by this simple procedure, but order of magnitude considerations demonstrate that this problem ordinarily is not prohibitively important. In flight, real‐time correction for topographic and terrain effects is not a major obstacle in the development of airborne gravity exploration.",10.1190/1.1440445
Modeling Of The Acoustic Wave Equation With Transform Methods,"Numerical methods are described for the simulation of wave phenomena with application to the modeling of seismic data. Two separate topics are studied. The first deals with the solution of the acoustic wave equation. The second topic treats wave phenomena whose direction of propagation is restricted within ±90 degrees from a given axis. In the numerical methods developed here, the wave field is advanced in time by using standard time differencing schemes. On the other hand, expressions including space derivative terms are computed by Fourier transform methods. This approach to computing derivatives minimizes truncation errors. Another benefit of transform methods becomes evident when attempting to restrict propagation to upward moving waves, e.g., to avoid multiple reflections. Constraints imposed on the direction of the wave propagation are accomplished most precisely in the wavenumber domain.     The error analysis of the algorithms shows that truncation errors are due mainly to time discretization. Such errors can be limited by the choice of the time step. Perhaps the most significant error phenomenon is related to aliasing. This becomes noticeable when a narrow pulse traverses a region with strong velocity variations. It is shown that aliasing errors can be limited by the choice of the pulse width. The feasibility of these modeling methods is demonstrated on numerical examples.",10.1190/1.1441223
Vertical Propagation Of Low-Frequency Waves In Finely Layered Media,"Multiple scattering in finely layered sediments is important for interpreting stratigraphic data, matching well-log data with seismic data, and seismic modeling. Two methods have been used to treat this problem in seismic applications: the O'Doherty-Anstey approximation and Backus averaging. The O'Doherty-Anstey approximation describes the stratigraphic-filtering effects, while Backus averaging defines the elastic properties for an effective medium from the stack of the layers. It is very important to know when the layered medium can be considered as an effective medium. In this paper, we only investigate vertical propagation. Therefore, no anisotropy effect is taken into consideration. Using the matrix-propagator method, we derive equations for transmission and reflection responses from the stack of horizontal layers. From the transmission response, we compute the phase velocity and compare the zero-frequency limit with the effective-medium velocity from Backus averaging. We also investigate how the transition from time-average medium to effective medium depends on contrast; i.e., strength of the reflection-coefficient series. Using numerical examples, we show that a transition zone exists between the effective medium (low-frequency limit) and the time-average medium (high-frequency limit), and that the width of this zone depends on the strength of the reflection-coefficient series.",10.1190/1.2197488
The Second Derivative Method Of Gravity Interpretation,"The second derivative method of interpreting gravity data, although its use is justifiable only on data of high accuracy, offers a simple routine method of locating some types of geologic anomalies of importance in oil and mineral reconnaissance. The theoretical formula by which it is possible to compute the second (vertical) derivative of any harmonic function from its values in a horizontal plane is derived for both the two‐dimensional and the three‐dimensional cases. The graphical method of computing the second derivative is discussed, especially as to the sources of error. A numerical coefficient equivalent of the graphical method is also presented. Formulas and graphs for the second derivative of the gravity effect of such geometrically simple shapes as the sphere, the infinite horizontal cylinder, the semi‐infinite horizontal plane, and the vertical fault, are presented with discussions of their value in the interpretation of practical data. Finally, the gravity and second derivative maps of portions of some important oil provinces are presented and compared to show the higher resolving power of the second derivative.",10.1190/1.1437648
Field Examples Of Negative Coincident‐Loop Transient Electromagnetic Responses Modeled With Polarizable Half‐Planes,"The negative transients observed in coincident‐loop measurements are believed to be caused by polarizable conductive structures (i.e., structures whose in‐phase conductivity increases with frequency). For most structures, it is not possible to predict negative transients as large as some of those observed in the field unless the polarizability is exceptionally large. Previous work shows that modest polarizabilities can be used to predict negative transients of the correct magnitudes when the conducting structures are such that the following qualitative conditions apply: (1) the transmitter is positioned proximal to the conducting structure in a manner which ensures a large early‐time fundamental inductive current is induced in the structure; (2) the polarization current is proximal to the receiver and results in a measurable negative polarization response; and (3) the positive response associated with the fundamental inductive current decays away sufficiently rapidly that the total response can change sign. These conditions are termed the ""favorable coupling conditions."" A polarizable half‐plane model is a structure which satisfies these conditions. The positions near the edge of the half‐plane, where the favorable coupling conditions are best satisfied, are those which are most conducive to observing negative transients. Field examples of negative transients associated with either an overburden which comes to an edge or a dipping sheet‐like structure can be modeled with a weakly polarizable half‐plane. We believe that most of the negative transients observed in the field are likely to be associated with structures which satisfy the favorable coupling conditions.",10.1190/1.1442613
Nonperturbational Surface-Wave Inversion: A Dix-Type Relation For Surface Waves,"We extend the approach underlying the well-known Dix equation in reflection seismology to surface waves. Within the context of surface wave inversion, the Dix-type relation we derive for surface waves allows accurate depth profiles of shear-wave velocity to be constructed directly from phase velocity data, in contrast to perturbational methods. The depth profiles can subsequently be used as an initial model for nonlinear inversion. We provide examples of the Dix-type relation for under-parameterized and over-parameterized cases. In the under-parameterized case, we use the theory to estimate crustal thickness, crustal shear-wave velocity, and mantle shear-wave velocity across the Western U.S. from phase velocity maps measured at 8-, 20-, and 40-s periods. By adopting a thin-layer formalism and an over-parameterized model, we show how a regularized inversion based on the Dix-type relation yields smooth depth profiles of shear-wave velocity. In the process, we quantitatively demonstrate the depth sensitivity of surface-wave phase velocity as a function of frequency and the accuracy of the Dix-type relation. We apply the over-parameterized approach to a near-surface data set within the frequency band from 5 to 40 Hz and find overall agreement between the inverted model and the result of full nonlinear inversion.",10.1190/geo2014-0612.1
"High‐Resolution, Cross‐Well Reflection Imaging: Potential And Technical Difficulties","The case study presented in this paper demonstrates that reflections can be found in high‐frequency cross‐well data. These reflections can be enhanced by a processing sequence similar to the one applied to VSP data to produce very high‐resolution images. Vertical resolution of the order of 3–5 ft (1–1.5 m) for well distances of a few hundred feet is potentially feasible. Although this study produced a good tie between the cross‐well reflection image and the sonic log, our research also illustrated some of the technical difficulties associated with cross‐well reflection imaging. Specifically, we found that the signal‐to‐noise ratio of the image decreases as the distance between the imaged reflection points and the wells increases, and that aliased tube waves as well as shear and converted waves were the main components of the noise. We also observed that interpretation of wide‐angle reflections might be misleading, since these events are significantly stretched, both horizontally and vertically, during imaging. Improvements are required both in data acquisition (denser data collection, more fold, smaller angles of incidence) and processing/imaging (optimal use of fold) to make cross‐well reflection imaging useful. Still, the quality of these preliminary results, produced from a single gather of aliased data, indicates the promise of the approach.",10.1190/1.1443510
An Analytic Generalized Inverse For Common‐Depth‐Point And Vertical Seismic Profile Traveltime Equations,"This paper presents an analytic formula for the generalized inverse matrix associated with vertical seismic profile (VSP) and common‐depth‐point (CDP) traveltime equations. Its functional form explicitly depends upon the source‐receiver geometry and its validity is restricted to horizontally layered earth models where there is negligible ray bending. The importance of the generalized inverse is that it can be used to derive closed‐form expressions for the covariance matrix, condition number, resolution matrix, and average inverse eigenvalues for the traveltime equations; these formulas are useful in designing source‐receiver geometries which optimize velocity reconstruction by traveltime inversion. These formulas also provide a fundamental understanding of some resolution limitations associated with earth tomography experiments. Previously, resolution characteristics of tomographic inversions were usually estimated by empirical computer tests on specialized earth models. Some specific conclusions drawn from these formulas include the following: (1) The elements of the slowness covariance matrix for uncorrelated traveltime errors depend only upon the length and number of ray segments which terminate in a layer, not on the number of rays which intersect a layer. (2) Better velocity resolution in a layer is achieved by increasing the length (larger source offset) and number (more sources) of rays which terminate in that layer. (3) Decreasing the layer thickness will result in a poorly conditioned set of equations; in fact, the L∞ condition number of the covariance matrix will increase faster than O(N2) as the number of layers N increases. (4) A tradeoff exists between better depth resolution and an increase in the variance of the slowness estimate. (5) The discrete generalized inverse is a back‐projection operator followed by a directional second‐order difference operator. The latter operator is a local and numerically tractable operator, while the equivalent filtering operation for the classical inverse Radon transform is a global Hilbert transform preceded by a first‐order derivative.",10.1190/1.1442465
A Geophysical Study Of A Basement Anomaly In Indiana,"Seismic, gravity, aeromagnetic, vertical, and horizontal magnetic surveys were made in Indiana as part of a statewide effort to study the basement complex. These surveys were interpreted collectively in a prescribed sequence that led to information ordinarily not obtained individually from such surveys. Prominent seismic reflections and sharp, coincident magnetic and gravity anomalies in Pulaski County, Indiana, were interpreted to show the depth, geometry, and rock type of an anomalous body within the basement complex. Seismic reflection data show the top of the anomalous body to be at a depth of 1.4 km. Analysis of the aeromagnetic anomaly indicates that the body can be approximated by a thick, vertical prism polarized along the earth's field. Second derivative analysis of the vertical magnetic anomaly outlines the body as roughly circular and 29km2 in area. Curve‐fitting between the observed vertical magnetic anomaly and an anomaly computed for the prismatic model readily shows that the body has a vertical dimension of 2.5 km and has a magnetic susceptibility contrast of 0.0088 cgs. Similar curve‐fitting based on the observed gravity anomally shows that the body has a density contrast of 0.21gm/cm3. Supporting evidence for the suggested susceptibility and density contrasts was obtained by substituting these values in Poisson's equation relating gravity and horizontal magnetic fields. Studies of basement rocks in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio support the interpretation that the anomalous body in Pulaski County is a basaltic plug intruded into a granitic basement and may have been one of a series of vents located along the Cincinnati arch that were the source for Precambrian basalt flows in Indiana.",10.1190/1.1439648
The Effects Of Data Quality In Local Earthquake Tomography: Application To The Alpine Region,"Despite the increase in quality and number of seismic stations in many parts of the world, accurate timing of individual arrival times remains crucial for many tomographic applications. To achieve a data set of high quality, arrival times need to be picked with high accuracy, including a proper assessment of the uncertainty of timing and phase identification, and a high level of consistency. We have investigated the effects of data quantity and quality on the solution quality in local earthquake tomography. We have compared tomographic results obtained with synthetic and real data of two very different data sets. The first data set consisted of a large set of arrival times of low precision and unknown accuracy taken from the International Seismological Centre (ISC) Bulletin for the greater Alpine region. The second high-quality data set for the same region was seven times smaller and was obtained by automated quality-weighted repicking. During a first series of inversions, synthetic data resembling the two data sets were inverted with the same amount of Gaussian distributed noise added. Subsequently, during a second series of inversions, the noise level was increased successively for ISC data to study the effect of larger Gaussian distributed error on the solution quality. Finally, the real data for both data sets were inverted. These investigations showed that, for Gaussian distributed error, a smaller data set of high quality could achieve a similar or better solution quality than a data set seven times larger but about four times lower in quality. Our results further suggest that the quality of the ISC Bulletin is degraded significantly by inconsistencies, strongly limiting the use of this large data set for local earthquake tomography studies.",10.1190/1.3237117
Universal Slide Rule For Linear Velocity Vs. Depth Calculations,"Described in detail in the main body of the paper is a circular slide rule designed to use for many calculations where the seismic velocity varies linearly with distance from a datum plane (usually horizontal), i.e., where V=V0+az. Here V0 is the velocity at datum and a is the rate of change of velocity with respect to depth z. Table I lists, in the first column, data that must be given and, in the second column, what may be found from it by using the present slide rule. Except for that of line 10, all calculations are limited only by the accuracy of reading the scales, which is sufficient for most practical purposes. The calculation of line 10 is approximate only, but needs correcting over only about 5 percent of its usually used range; this correction is very simply made.",10.1190/1.1437344
Traveltime Prediction And Suppression Of 3-D Multiples,"We analyze the characteristics and suppression of multiples generated in three dimensions. We derive expressions for the traveltime of peg‐leg multiples generated by two dipping planes. Using this theory, we demonstrate that multiples generated in three dimensions may have traveltimes substantially different from 2-D multiples. For a case studied of 3° cross‐line dip, second‐order water‐bottom and peg‐leg multiples arrive on the order of 10 ms earlier than they would in two dimensions. For fifth‐order multiples, this difference is as high as 65 ms. These 2-D/3-D time differences grow to many hundreds of milliseconds for 10° of cross‐line dip. We confirm the presence of the cross‐line dip effect in field data containing salt‐related multiples. Using dips estimated from a 3-D interpretation of a top‐salt horizon, we further demonstrate that the theory can accurately predict traveltimes for such multiples. Finally, based on the theory, we present an algorithm for suppressing 3-D multiples when cross‐line dip can be estimated, validating the algorithm using model and field data.",10.1190/1.1444523
Notes On Fraser S. Grant'S Paper: 'A Theory For The Regional Correction Of Potential Field Data',"In an eloquent paper Grant (1954) has commented briefly on my paper, 'Regional Correction of Gravity Data' (Vajk, 1951), stating that I argue in favor of graphical methods in determining a regional gravity effect and objected strongly to my conclusions that '…the regional effect cannot be determined uniquely. t is an interpretation problem which cannot be solved by some mechanical mathematical methods but only by analysis of the gravity data. Such determination is unavoidably a subject of personal factors as is every gravity (or magnetic) interpretation'.",10.1190/1.19030002.1
Spontaneous Potential Log Response Expressed As Convolution,"A special case of spontaneous potential (SP) logging, which has a closed‐form solution, will be expressed as a convolutional operation. Such a formal demonstration serves two purposes. First, it separates the individual contribution of the tool from that of the earth. Second, it places this logging device within the mathematical context of signal analysis. The special case for which a closed‐form solution is known is that where all resistivities are equal. Fourier analysis applied to this solution leads to a product of two functions, of which one is identified as the contribution of the earth and the other of the tool.",10.1190/1.1441395
Least‐Squares Wave‐Equation Migration For Avp/Ava Inversion,"The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined with two synthetic examples. In the first case, we generated acoustic finite difference data for a horizontally layered model. The AVP functions based on the migrated/inverted ray parameter CIGs were converted to AVA plots. The AVA plots were then compared to the true acoustic AVA of the reflectors. The constrained least‐squares inversion compares favorably with the conventional migration, especially when incompleteness compromises the data. In the second example, we use the Marmousi data set to test the algorithm in complex media. The result shows that least‐squares migration can mitigate kinematic artifacts in the ray‐parameter domain CIGs effectively.",10.1190/1.1543212
Selection Of A Suitable Model For Quantitative Interpretation Of Towed‐Bird Aem Measurements,"Many steeply dipping massive sulfide ore bodies have a dike‐like shape, and this has led to wide acceptance of the vertical half‐plane model in the interpretation of electromagnetic data. This model assumes that the conductor is thin, but the restriction has not been considered critical and in practice has frequently been disregarded. Conductance and conductor depth estimates based on the results of towed‐bird AEM surveys have been observed to be lower and less accurate than those obtained from helicopter EM and ground EM measurements. In order to explain the low reliability of the towed‐bird estimates, AEM responses over 17 Canadian ore bodies were analyzed. In the study, field results obtained by the time‐domain Input system and two dual‐frequency quadrature systems were interpreted. Error in conductance and depth estimates results from the frequency‐dependent, diffusive behavior of thick geologic conductors. This dependence makes invalid the basic assumption made in the interpretation of dual‐frequency quadrature EM data, that of the equivalence of response parameters at two frequencies. The estimated conductance and depth are too small when applying the current interpretation procedure based on amplitude ratios at two high and widely separated frequencies. The error is smaller in the case of Input time‐domain measurements, because the delay times are relatively long and the channels narrowly spaced. The vertical half‐plane model has been found to hold for ore bodies less than 10 m wide. In the case of wide mineralized zones, which are more important economically, the vertical half‐plane model could be successfully applied only at long delay times. Applying the vertical half‐plane nomogram at short delay times, the conductance and depth were underestimated, and better values could only be achieved by fitting the field data to a horizontal ribbon model. The consistently low conductance values interpreted from towed‐bird measurements for wide conductive zones have probably resulted in not selecting many potential massive sulfide targets for ground followup.",10.1190/1.1440838
Detection And Extraction Of Fault Surfaces In 3D Seismic Data,"We propose an efficient method for detecting and extracting fault surfaces in 3D-seismic volumes. The seismic data are transformed into a volume of local-fault-extraction (LFE) estimates that represents the likelihood that a given point lies on a fault surface. We partition the fault surfaces into relatively small linear portions, which are identified by analyzing tilted and rotated subvolumes throughout the region of interest. Directional filtering and thresholding further enhance the seismic discontinuities that are attributable to fault surfaces. Subsequently, the volume of LFE estimates is skeletonized, and individual fault surfaces are extracted and labeled in the order of decreasing size. The ultimate result obtained by the proposed procedure provides a visual and semantic representation of a set of well-defined, cleanly separated, one-pixel-thick, labeled fault surfaces that is readily usable for seismic interpretation.",10.1190/1.2215357
A Theoretical Study Of Acoustic S-Wave And P-Wave Velocity Logging With Conventional And Dipole Sources In Soft Formations,"This paper is focused on the special features of the wavetrains recorded by conventional and dipole sonic logging tools in soft formations defined to be those whose shar velocity is less than the sound velocity of drilling mud. Such formations are commonn in the Gulf Coast, the Canadian Arctic, the Bass Strait of Australia, and many other region. A conventional logging tool operating at normal frequencies (f∼15kHz) records P waves, water waves, and Stoneley waves in soft formations. A dipole tool records modal waves and water waves at frequencies of order 15 kHz, but produces almost pure S-wave first arrivals at low frequencies (f∼1kHz), since at 1 kHz, a mode which we refer to as a ""dipole Stoneley wave"" is efficiently excited. For very soft materials such as clays, where the formation P-wave velocity can be less than the fluid velocity, the formation P velocity can be logged by operating a conventional sonic tool at low frequencies (f∼1kHz) so as to excite a leaky mode traveling at very close to the formation P-wave velocity. Water waves are not important for high‐velocity formations where they arrive at the trailing edge of the modal part of the wavetrain. However, in soft formalions they form a prominent part of the wavetrain at normal logging frequencies (f∼15kHz) and disappear at low frequencies (f∼1kHz). Water waves are carried by leaky modes.",10.1190/1.1442411
"Detection Of Reservoirs From Normalized Full Gradient Of Gravity Anomalies And Its Application To Shengli Oil Field, East China","Applying the NFG method to the Shengli oil field, i.e., using closed minima of NFG alongside drilling data, showed an effectiveness of up to 70%. These results were used to select well locations with the result that some high‐production gas‐bearing strata were discovered by drilling.",10.1190/1.1500375
Diffraction Tomography For Inhomogeneities In Layered Background Medium,"Diffraction tomography was originally formulated for a constant velocity background medium. A variable background medium, e.g., layered, with embedded finer scale heterogeneities is a more practical model for subsurface reservoirs than the uniform background. The variable background of large scale variations may be determined from well logs or transmission tomography. To image the finer scale heterogeneities, we have developed a Fourier diffraction back‐propagation method for point sources in a layered background. The method is based on the normal mode solution to the acoustic wave equation in cylindrical coordinates. The Fourier spectrum of the scattered fields is first decomposed into contributions from different layers. Then, a selection rule is applied to sort out the heterogeneity spectrum of the individual layers. The selection rule relates the scattered field in diffraction space to the spectrum of the heterogeneities, i.e., a Fourier diffraction theorem for layered media. The theorem differs from its counterpart for a uniform background medium by a matrix filter that reduces to unity as the stratification degenerates to a uniform background. A reconstruction algorithm based on this theorem is implemented and tested for an arbitrary layered background. The theory deals directly with point sources; therefore, the resulting algorithm does not require application of the ""2.5-D correction"" to field data as required in previously published diffraction tomography algorithms. Results obtained for both synthetic and field data demonstrate that an inversion with spatial resolution on the order of a wavelength can be achieved for crosswell data. The computations involved are much more efficient than those of traveltime tomography or crosswell migration. Unlike migration or CDP mapping, the diffraction tomography algorithm provides quantitative estimates for fine scale velocity.",10.1190/1.1443983
Three‐Layer Resistivity Curves For The Eltran Electrode Configuration,A method is described by which standard curves of apparent resistivity vs. electrode separation can be calculated for certain electrode configurations from the published data for the Wenner configuration. Data are given for plotting curves representing 15 sets of values of the three layer parameters in the case of the Eltran configuration.,10.1190/1.1441792
A Microelectromechanical System Digital 3C Array Seismic Cone Penetrometer,"A digital 3C array seismic cone penetrometer has been developed for multidisciplinary geophysical and geotechnical applications. Seven digital triaxial microelectromechanical system accelerometers are installed at 0.25-m intervals to make a 1.5-m-long downhole seismic array. The accelerometers have a flat response up to 2 kHz. The seismic array is attached to a class 1 digital seismic cone, which measures cone tip resistance, sleeve friction, pore-pressure, and inclination. The downhole 3C array can be used together with impulsive seismic sources and/or high-frequency vibrators that are suitable for high-resolution shallow applications. Results from two field experiments showed that a good data quality, including a constant source function within an array, and a dense depth-sampling allowed robust estimation of seismic velocity profiles in the shallow subsoil. Using horizontal and vertical seismic sources, downhole 9C seismic array data can be easily acquired. The quality of the shear-wave data is much superior when the surface seismic source is a controlled, high-frequency vibrator in stead of a traditional sledge hammer. A remarkable correlation in depth, in a fine scale, between low-strain seismic shear wave velocity and high-strain cone tip resistance could be observed. The array measurements of the full-elastic wavefield and the broad spectral bandwidth are useful in investigating frequency-dependent seismic wave propagation in the porous near-surface soil layers, which is informative of the in situ fluid-flow properties. Stable estimates of dispersive seismic velocity and attenuation can be obtained.",10.1190/geo2011-0266.1
Least-Squares Migration In The Presence Of Velocity Errors,"Seismic migration requires an accurate background velocity model that correctly predicts the kinematics of wave propagation in the true subsurface. Least-squares migration, which seeks the inverse rather than the adjoint of a forward modeling operator, is especially sensitive to errors in this background model. This can result in traveltime differences between predicted and observed data that lead to incoherent and defocused migration images. We have developed an alternative misfit function for use in least-squares migration that measures amplitude differences between predicted and observed data, i.e., differences after correcting for nonzero traveltime shifts between predicted and observed data. We demonstrated on synthetic and field data that, when the background velocity model is incorrect, the use of this misfit function results in better focused migration images. Results suggest that our method best enhances image focusing when differences between predicted and observed data can be explained by traveltime shifts.",10.1190/geo2013-0374.1
Wave Propagation In A Layered Model Due To Point Source Loading In A High‐Impedance Medium,"Dynamic photoelastic techniques were used to study the incident, reflected, and refracted waves in a layered model. The model, consisting of two birefringent layers with an impedance ratio of 2.2:1, was subjected to point source explosive loading in the high‐impedance medium. The isochromatic fringe patterns were photographed with a Cranz‐Schardin multiple spark camera operating at a rate of 200,000 frames per second. Propagation and attenuation characteristics of waves in both layers were studied.",10.1190/1.1440189
Mapping Formation Radial Shear-Wave Velocity Variation By A Constrained Inversion Of Borehole Flexural-Wave Dispersion Data,"We have developed a novel constrained inversion method for estimating a radial shear-wave velocity profile away from the wellbore using dipole acoustic logging data and have analyzed the effect of the radial velocity changes on dipole-flexural-wave dispersion characteristics. The inversion of the dispersion data to estimate the radial changes is inherently a nonunique problem because changing the degree of variation or the radial size of the variation zone can produce similar wave-dispersion characteristics. Nonuniqueness can be solved by developing a constrained inversion method. This is done by constraining the high-frequency portion of the model dispersion curve with another curve calculated using the near-borehole velocity. The constraint condition is based on the physical principle that a high-frequency dipole wave has a shallow penetration depth and is therefore sensitive to the near-borehole shear-wave velocity. We have validated the result of the constrained inversion with synthetic data testing. Combining the new inversion method with four-component crossed-dipole anisotropy processing obtains shear radial profiles in fast and slow shear polarization directions. In a sandstone formation, the fast and slow shear-wave profiles show substantial differences caused by the near-borehole stress field, demonstrating the ability of the technique to obtain radial and azimuthal geomechanical property changes near the wellbore.",10.1190/1.3502664
"Processing, Inversion, And Interpretation Of A 2D Seismic Data Set From The North Viking Graben, North Sea","The Vp/Vs–Swv plane still does not produce unique interpretation in many situations. However, the critical distinction, which is between hydrocarbon‐bearing sands and all other geologic/reservoir configurations, is defined. Swv ≤ 0.17 and Vp/Vs ≤ 1.8 are the criteria that delineate potential reservoirs in this area, with decreasing Swv indicating a higher gas/oil ratio, and decreasing Vp/Vs indicating a higher sand/shale ratio. As these criteria are locally calibrated, they appear to be valid locally; they should not be applied to other data sets, which may exhibit significantly different relationships. However, the overall procedure should be generally applicable.",10.1190/1.1581036
Double-Sparsity Dictionary For Seismic Noise Attenuation,"A key step in sparsifying signals is the choice of a sparsity-promoting dictionary. There are two basic approaches to design such a dictionary: the analytic approach and the learning-based approach. Although the analytic approach enjoys the advantage of high efficiency, it lacks adaptivity to various data patterns. On the other hand, the learning-based approach can adaptively sparsify different data sets but has a heavier computational complexity and involves no prior-constraint pattern information for particular data. We have developed a double-sparsity dictionary (DSD) for seismic data to combine the benefits of both approaches. We have evaluated two models to learn the DSD: the synthesis model and the analysis model. The synthesis model learns DSD in the data domain, and the analysis model learns DSD in the model domain. We tested the analysis model and proposed to use the seislet transform and data-driven tight frame (DDTF) as the base transform and adaptive dictionary, respectively, in the DSD framework. The DDTF obtains an extra structure regularization by learning dictionaries, whereas the seislet transform obtains a compensation for the transformation error caused by slope dependency. The DSD aims to provide a sparser representation than the individual transform and dictionary and, therefore, can help to achieve better performance in denoising applications. Although for the purpose of compression, the DSD is less sparse than the seislet transform, it outperforms the seislet and DDTF in distinguishing the signal and noise. Two simulated synthetic examples and three field data examples confirm a better denoising performance of the proposed approach.",10.1190/geo2014-0525.1
"A Microearthquake Survey At The Ngawha Geothermal Field, New Zealand","A twenty day microearthquake survey of the Ngawha geothermal field, New Zealand, was undertaken in order to establish the level of preproduction seismicity and to test the usefulness of such surveys in geothermal exploration. The Ngawha geothermal field, in the far northwest of the North Island (Northland) is associated with a region of Quaternary basaltic volcanism. It is not a part of the much more extensive Taupo volcanic zone in the central North Island, site of the well‐known Wairakei geothermal field, among others. Although surface thermal activity at Ngawha is limited to a few relatively small hot springs, resistivity surveys have outlined a 25-50km2 area of hot water at the 1-km depth level (Macdonald et al. , 1977). Test bores to that depth have encountered temperatures of up to 250 °C within Mesozoic graywacke. Overlying the graywacke is about 500 m of Cenozoic claystone and siltstone which forms an impermeable cap.",10.1190/1.1441153
"The Paleoproterozoic Kristineberg Mining Area, Northern Sweden: Results From Integrated 3D Geophysical And Geologic Modeling, And Implications For Targeting Ore Deposits","The Kristineberg mining area in the western part of the Paleoproterozoic Skellefte Ore District, northern Sweden, is well known for its base-metal and recent gold discoveries. A pilot 3D geologic model has been constructed on a crustal scale, covering an area of   30×30 km   to depths of   10 km  . Constrained 3D inverse and forward gravity modeling have been performed to confirm and refine previous modeling along seismic profiles using mainly 2.5D techniques. The 3D inverse gravity modeling was geared to generating isodensity surfaces that enclose regions within the model of anomalous density contrast. The 3D forward gravity modeling was conducted to include faulting and folding systems that are difficult to include in the inversion. The 3D geologic model supports many previous interpretations but also reveals new features of the regional geology that are important for future targeting of base-metal and gold deposits. The margins of a thick granite in the south dip steeply inward, suggesting the possibility of room to accommodate another large base-metal deposit if the granitic rocks are juxtaposed with volcanic rocks at depth. Gravity modeling also suggests the observed Bouguer gravity high within the western metasediments can be explained by a large mafic intrusion that has dioritic to tonalitic composition and no significant magnetic signature. Because mafic-ultramafic intrusions within metasediments can indicate gold, this interpretation suggests the western metasediments have a high gold potential.",10.1190/1.3008053
Detection Of Subbottom Ice‐Bonded Permafrost On The Canadian Beaufort Shelf By Ground Electromagnetic Measurements,"Accurate knowledge of the location of subbottom ice‐bonded permafrost is essential in planning major infrastructure projects such as pipelines in the Arctic. A combination of refraction and shallow reflection seismic surveys and drilling has been considered the most effective means of permafrost detection in offshore environments. Field experiments recently carried out on the Beaufort Shelf by the Geological Survey of Canada indicate that multifrequency horizontal‐loop electromagnetic (HLEM) measurements are a fast and cost‐effective alternative. During test surveys, 60 to 80 soundings were completed in a day. Analysis of HLEM field data shows that a four‐layer model is appropriate for the local geologic conditions. The first layer in the model, sea ice, is highly resistive (5000  Ω ⋅ m). The second layer consists of seawater and seawater‐saturated sediments (estimated resistivity 1 Ω ⋅ m). Because their true resistivities are not significantly different, it was not possible to separate the two highly conductive layers by inversion. The target of the survey, subbottom ice‐bonded permafrost, was the third layer in the section (resistivity 5000 Ω ⋅ m). The bottom layer is formed by unfrozen sediments (average resistivity 2 Ω ⋅ m). Comparison with seismic and drilling results indicates that detection of ice‐bonded permafrost by the HLEM method is reliable; the outlines of its upper boundary given by seismic and HLEM measurements are in good agreement. At the only borehole available, unconstrained inversion of HLEM data provided an accurate estimate of permafrost depth and thickness, but there is not enough drilling information to objectively assess the reliability of the technique.",10.1190/1.1443209
"Fault Interpretation From High‐Resolution Seismic Data In The Northern Negev, Israel","Detection and investigation of fault zones are important tools for tectonic analysis and geological studies. A fault zone inferred on high‐resolution seismic lines has been interpreted using a method of detection of diffracted waves utilizing the main kinematic and dynamic properties of the wavefield. The application of the method to field data from the northern Negev in Israel shows that it provides a good estimate of results and, when used in conjunction with the final stacked data, can give the suspected location of the fault, its sense (reverse or normal), and the amount of ""low amplitude"" displacement (in an order of the wavelength or even less).",10.1190/1.1443117
The Inversion Of Time‐Domain Airborne Electromagnetic Data Using The Plate Model,"Airborne electromagnetic (EM) methods were developed in the early 1950s, mostly by Canadian mining exploration companies as a means of economically carrying out prospecting for sulfide deposits associated with volcanics in resistive shield areas. Present interpretation techniques are based on the use of nomograms but the approach is easily amenable to digital processing. For highly accurate interpretation, however, it is necessary to develop quantitative interpretation techniques that can make full use of all the data available. Inverse theory has been used for interpretation with great success in most geophysical disciplines; however, in airborne EM surveying, inversion has only been used for the interpretation of airborne EM data using half‐space and one‐layer models. By introducing some approximations to the rectangular thin‐plate model, it is now possible to apply inverse theory to the interpretation of time‐domain EM data. This approach provides estimates of the parameter errors, the correlation matrix, and a means of assessing the validity of the model. Synthetic profile data are used to demonstrate the validity of the method. The results of the inversion of real anomalies are compared with ground geophysical survey interpretation and drillhole data. The inversion results agree with the known geology of the area and the ground geophysical survey interpretation.",10.1190/1.1442882
Elementary Approximations In Aeromagnetic Interpretation,"Total magnetic intensity anomaly expressions are derived for four simple sources: the point pole' line of poles, point dipole and line of dipoles. Type curves are presented for the point pole and dipole. For all cases, factors are calculated which may be multiplied into the half‐maximum distances on the anomaly profiles to yield depth estimates. These methods serve as a first approximation in the interpretation of aeromagnetic data, but their limitations must be kept in mind. Two examples of the application of the methods are given.",10.1190/1.1438294
Shear‐Wave Recording Using Continuous Signal Methods Part I—Early Development,"In recent years, it has been found possible to record shear‐wave reflections and horizontally traveling shear waves using continuous signal methods. Thus paper traces the equipment development and field work performed during this research. The earliest work with a version of a swinging‐weight vibrator showed that shear‐wave reflections could be recorded. This fact provided the impetus to make modifications to equipment to meet difficulties caused by lack of energy and lack of frequency bandwidth. Examples are given which show the flexibility of the system in providing comparison between the horizontally traveling surface waves induced and recorded by the various combinations of vibrator sources and geophone types and their relative orientations. Frequency selection by the different modes is well illustrated. For most of the reflection examples, the average ratio of shear‐wave velocity to compressional‐wave velocity in the first few thousands of feet is near 0.5. Finally, to complete the early development, the version of the shear‐wave vibrator and recording system which was used for most of the additional work is described. In order to make comparison of P‐wave and SH‐wave reflection records easier, this system provided for a 2:1 compression of the shear‐wave time scale as well as a 2:1 ratio of frequency output between the P‐ and SH‐vibrator systems. A few examples of SH reflection profiles achieved with this system are presented.",10.1190/1.1439924
An Exact Solution Of The Conversion Point For The Converted Waves From A Dipping Reflector With Homogeneous (Isotropic) Overburden,"For converted waves, stacking traces with a common reflection point, forming gathers, and performing dip moveout (DMO) all require accurately calculating the location of conversion points. Because of the asymmetrical paths of converted waves, even for horizontally layered media, the calculation of a conversion point for converted waves is complicated. Previous authors have obtained analytic solutions for the conversion point for converted waves in a horizontally layered media. We extend those results to the more general case of converted waves from a dipping reflector with a homogeneous, isotropic overburden. By using Snell's law, we derive a quartic equation and solve it uniquely for the conversion point. The resultant analytic expression is a function of offset, compressional-, and shear-wave velocities; normal reflector depth; and dip angle at the conversion point. This solution can be readily used to generate accurate synthetic seismic responses for converted waves based on ray theory. It also can be extended to operators for stacking converted waves and applying DMO correction.",10.1190/1.2149900
"Transient Electromagnetic Responses Of Surficial, Polarizable Patches","Abnormal decay curves that are depressed or change sign often are observed in coincident‐loop and central‐loop transient electromagnetic (TEM) measurements, particularly in areas of conductive overburden. With the publication of papers by Smith and West (1989a, b) and Flis et al. (1989), the phenomenon, which is due to induced polarization (IP) in near‐surface, weakly polarizable material such as clay, is well understood.",10.1190/1.1442921
Wave Propagation In Heterogeneous Porous Media Formulated In The Frequency-Space Domain Using A Discontinuous Galerkin Method,"Biphasic media with a dynamic interaction between fluid and solid phases must be taken into account to accurately describe seismic wave amplitudes in subsurface and reservoir geophysical applications. Consequently, the modeling of the wave propagation in heteregeneous porous media, which includes the frequency-dependent phenomena of the fluid-solid interaction, is considered for 2D geometries. From the Biot-Gassmann theory, we have deduced the discrete linear system in the frequency domain for a discontinuous finite-element method, known as the nodal discontinuous Galerkin method. Solving this system in the frequency domain allows accurate modeling of the Biot wave in the diffusive/propagative regimes, enhancing the importance of frequency effects. Because we had to consider finite numerical models, we implemented perfectly matched layer techniques. We found that waves are efficiently absorbed at the model boundaries, and that the discretization of the medium should follow the same rules as in the elastodynamic case, that is, 10 grids per minimum wavelength for a P0 interpolation order. The grid spreading of the sources, which could be stresses or forces applied on either the solid phase or the fluid phase, did not show any additional difficulties compared to the elastic problem. For a flat interface separating two media, we compared the numerical solution and a semianalytic solution obtained by a reflectivity method in the three regimes where the Biot wave is propagative, diffusive/propagative, and diffusive. In all cases, fluid-solid interactions were reconstructed accurately, proving that attenuation and dispersion of the waves were correctly accounted for. In addition to this validation in layered media, we have explored the capacities of modeling complex wave propagation in a laterally heterogeneous porous medium related to steam injection in a sand reservoir and the seismic response associated to a fluid substitution.",10.1190/1.3581361
In‐Situ Determination Of The Remanent Magnetic Vector Of Two‐Dimensional Tabular Bodies,"Recent studies have shown that many rocks of the earth's crust have a substantial component of remanent magnetization. Extensive sampling is required to determine adequately the remanent vector from small samples. A field technique has been developed (and tested on model data) for the in‐situ determination of the resultant (induced+remanent) magnetic vector of bulk volumes of rock, using a combined analysis of the gravity and magnetic fields of a disturbing body (Poisson's Theorem). The potential fields are sampled adequately at a limited expenditure of time and effort in the field by utilizing the geometry of two‐dimensional bodies. The major limitation to the analysis is the removal of regional gradients and the estimation of the base levels of anomalies. Combined gravity and magnetic surveys were conducted over six diabase bodies in the Triassic Basin of Pennsylvania. The results of these surveys indicate a resultant direction of magnetization given approximately by: declination 2° W, inclination 41 degrees below the horizon. The corresponding direction of natural remanent magnetization has a declination of 1° W and an inclination of 28 degrees. The ratio of remanent to induced magnetization for the diabase is approximately two. These results have been used to provide a better interpretation of magnetic survey data over a magnetite deposit in the Triassic Basin.",10.1190/1.1439826
The Matter Of Size: On The Moment Magnitude Of Microseismic Events,"We investigated the method of estimating seismic moment and moment magnitude for microseismic events. We determined that the M0T defined by Bowers and Hudson is the proper scalar moment to be used in microseismic studies for characterizing the size of an event and calculating its moment magnitude. For non-double-couple sources, the proportional relationship between body-wave amplitude and seismic moment in the Brune model breaks down. So under such situations, the Brune model is not an appropriate way to estimate the seismic moment and magnitude. Moreover, the S-wave alone is not sufficient for determining the total seismic moment. Instead, the P-wave must be analyzed. An example Barnett Shale data set was studied, and the results concluded that the magnitudes estimated with the Brune model could be off by as much as 1.92, with an absolute average of 0.35. The moment magnitudes based on the scalar moment M0T also gave a significantly different event size distribution and b-value estimation. Finally, attenuation also played a role in estimating the moment magnitude. With a typical average attenuation factor of Q=70, the average magnitude correction for our field data set was on the order of 0.15. However, it could reach 0.3 for events far away from the monitoring well.",10.1190/geo2013-0194.1
Automatic Interpretation Of Magnetic Dike Parameters Using The Analytical Signal Technique,"The analytical signal of the magnetic field is used to automatically determine the source parameters of dikelike structures. The method is particularly useful for interpreting large amounts of data collected during airborne surveys because it makes full use of the high density of data along the flight lines while simultaneously checking for two‐dimensionality and strike directions by searching for coherent signals in neighboring profiles. The maximum horizontal curvature of the amplitude of the analytical signal is used to locate the dikes along a given profile. Tests with synthetic data show that the dike's horizontal position is resolved accurately. Magnetic data from the Siljan impact structure in Sweden show that the estimated strikes are reliable and that dip, depth, and width estimates are coherent, especially for well‐isolated dikelike structures.",10.1190/1.1444946
Inductive Coupling Of A Homogeneous Ground With A Vertical Coil,"The problem of the ""magnetic pulsating pole"" is examined from an analytical viewpoint and an integral solution is reached with the use of Hankel's Integrals. However, a complete explanation was derived only with respect to the horizontal component of the magnetic field. In addition the problem of the ""pulsating magnetic dipole"" is also explored and similarly a complete explanation is derived only for the horizontal component. The application of the results of these analyses to field prospecting methods is also discussed.",10.1190/1.1437556
Simulation And Modeling Of Ultrasonic Pitch-Catch Through-Tubing Logging,"Cased petroleum wells must be logged to determine the bonding and hydraulic isolation properties of the sealing material and to determine the structural integrity status. Although ultrasonic pitch-catch logging in single-casing geometries has been widely studied and is commercially available, this is not the case for logging in double-casing geometries despite its increasing importance in plug and abandonment operations. It is therefore important to investigate whether existing logging tools can be used in such geometries. Using a finite-element model of a double-casing geometry with a two-receiver pitch-catch setup, we have simulated through-tubing logging, with fluid between the two casings. We found that there appears a cascade of leaky Lamb wave packets on both casings, linked by leaked wavefronts. By varying the geometry and materials in the model, we have examined the effect on the pulse received from the second wave packet on the inner casing, sometimes known as the third interface echo. The amplitude of this pulse was found to contain information on the bonded material in the outer annulus. Much stronger amplitude variations were found with two equally thick casings than with a significant thickness difference; relative thickness differences of up to one-third were simulated. Finally, we have developed a simple mathematical model of the wave packets' time evolution to encapsulate and validate our understanding of the wave packet cascade. This model shows a more complex time evolution in the later wave packets than the exponentially attenuated primary packet, which is currently used for single-casing logging. This indicates that tools with more than two receivers, which could measure wave packets' amplitude at more than two points along their time evolution, would be able to draw more information from these later packets. The model was validated against simulations, finding good agreement when the underlying assumptions of the model were satisfied.",10.1190/geo2015-0251.1
Predicting Porosity From Acoustic Velocities In Siliciclastics: A New Look,"Two principally different mechanisms of porosity reduction‐induced elastic stiffening of siliciclastic rocks are recognized, which, in the domain of grain‐supported siliciclastics with less than 15% volume clay, result in two linear trends with different slopes in the acoustic velocity‐porosity plane. Transition between the two mechanisms occurs at about 30% porosity and roughly coincides with the transition from (1) early diagenesis, characterized by mechanical compaction and initial intergranular bonding, to (2) advanced chemical diagenesis caused by pressure solution and cementation. Peculiarities of velocity‐stress relations in each of these diagenetic domains suggest that while the stress factor is important in loose sandstones, it has practically very little effect on the frame moduli of consolidated (less than about 30% porosity) sandstones at stress magnitudes beyond the closure stress of microcracks introduced by natural or coring‐related processes. Appropriate grain contact and effective medium theories have been used to model the framework stiffening in the two diagenetic domains, respectively. It is shown that realistic, petrographically observed evolution of pore geometries in consolidated sandstones can be successfully modeled, resulting in a quasi‐linear velocity‐porosity relationship deviating from linearity within the accuracy of velocity measurements. A new look at the compilation of experimental data on acoustic velocities in clay matrix‐supported siliciclastics (more than 15% volume clay), including 45 shales and 19 wackes, accounts for their distinct stress‐sensitivity and anisotropy and suggests that their bedding‐normal elastic stiffness varies nonlinearly in the whole range of porosity reduction from around 80% to almost zero. However, in the velocity‐porosity plane below about 30% porosity, shales also show strong linear relationships with slopes subparallel to those of the grain‐supported rocks.",10.1190/1.1444111
Spectral Properties Of The Earth'S Contribution To Seismic Resolution,Layered reflectivity sequences have spectral signatures (impulse responses) in accordance with time‐frequency transformations. These signatures are filtered by a source under the convolutional definition of a seismogram. Spectral signatures of wedge models indicate that thin layers have preferred source bandwidths needed to produce either a tuned reflection or separate interface reflections. Sources that do not include these preferred frequencies do not produce optimally imaged reflections. Criteria for the classic tuning thickness and behavior of source‐dependent amplitude versus time‐thickness crossplots are better understood in relation to the reflectivity impulse response. Reflectivity spectra indicate that higher‐order tuning thicknesses exist. Earth reflectivity also prevents the return of certain source frequencies; this behavior may possibly be an interpretive tool.,10.1190/1.1443752
"Analysis Of Potential Field Anomalies In Lavrion Mining Area, Greece","Mining activities in Lavrion began during the first millennium B.C. after the decline of ancient Athens and then restarted more deliberately during the nineteenth century. Aeromagnetic data from a 1967 survey of the mining area was recompiled, processed, and interpreted for the present study. The original flight lines were digitized and leveled, and the international geomagnetic reference field (IGRF) was removed. The data were inverted by means of a terracing technique that defines separate domains of uniform distribution of physical properties that cause the magnetic anomalies. The log power spectrum was computed; along with the results of terracing, it suggested the existence of two sources of the magnetic anomaly. The long‐wavelength anomaly reflects a large, concealed body that is most probably a granitic intrusion, consistent with local geological evidence. The source of the short‐wavelength anomaly is a strongly magnetized body attributed to the net effect of various thin, magnetite‐bearing sulfide zones. The anomalies were then separated in the wavenumber domain. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made in situ on the exposed parts of the local formations. Three‐dimensional models whose effect simulates the observed anomalies were calculated. Results of the modeling show that the large magnetic body is buried at 0.68 km depth. The small, relatively shallow body is about 0.035 km thick and buried at 0.6 km depth. The bodies do not show any corresponding gravity anomaly on the regional Bouguer gravity anomaly map.",10.1190/1.1444490
Electrical Geophysics In The U.S.S.R.,"As part of the Australia‐U.S.S.R. science exchange program, the author spent four months in 1977 in the Soviet Union, observing EM and IP of geophysical exploration. The main fields covered in discussions were transient electromagnetics (TEM), induced polarization, downhole induction, radio wave shadowing, electrochemical exploration, and seismoelectricity. The performance of a prototype of Sirotem, the latest Australian TEM instrumentation developed by CSIRO, was compared with the prototype of the latest Soviet TEM instrumentation, the MPP-4.",10.1190/1.1441050
Parameter Nonuniqueness In Velocity Versus Depth Functions,"Except for hypothetical cases that are never encountered in practice, the solution for the parameters of analytic velocity versus depth functions is inherently nonunique. This nonuniqueness means that there is no particular parameter combination that represents ""the"" solution. The average discrepancy between the observed velocity‐depth (or time‐depth) curve and the calculated function curve gives a measure of the degree of fit between the two curves. In the parameter space, within a given degree of fit that may be considered as the margin of tolerance for the particular problem in hand, every parameter combination provides a valid solution. The solution trough is defined as the region in the parameter space containing these solutions. The shape of the solution trough depends on the relationship between the parameters and, therefore, on the form of the function being used. If the parameters are related linearly or if the relation is linearized then the axis of the solution trough is a straight line. The slope of the axis corresponds to a point close to the average depth of the interval to which the observed data pertain. The intercept corresponds to a velocity value that is quite close to the average velocity over the interval. These properties are extremely useful for understanding the nature of the solution trough in parameter space. Hence, composite displays of solution troughs pertaining to a number of wells can be interpreted to provide information on whether the unit to which the function corresponds has undergone any lateral changes. Such displays also illustrate how current practices that assume the existence of a unique or ""true"" solution need to be critically revised.",10.1190/1.1444203
Linear Inverse Gaussian Theory And Geostatistics,"This work is a contribution to both linear inverse problem theory and geostatistics. Our main result is an efficient method to generate realizations, actual solutions rather than the conventional least-squares-based approach, to any Gaussian linear inverse problem using a noniterative method. The sequential approach to solving linear and weakly nonlinear problems is computationally efficient compared with traditional least-squares-based inversion. The sequential approach also allows one to solve the inverse problem in only a small part of the model space while conditioned to all available data. From a geostatistical point of view, the method can be used to condition realizations of Gaussian random fields to the possibly noisy linear average observations of the model space.",10.1190/1.2345195
A Fast And Accurate Frequency Estimation Method For Canceling Harmonic Noise In Geophysical Records,"The cancellation of harmonic noise from geophysical records can be achieved by subtracting an estimate of the harmonic noise. Estimating the harmonic noise consists of estimating the fundamental frequency and the amplitudes and phases of all harmonics. We propose a new frequency-estimation method that builds upon the estimator originally proposed by Nyman and Gaiser. This Nyman and Gaiser estimation (NGE) method exploits the fact that the noise fundamental frequency is known to be close to 60 Hz. The NGE method is based on solving a system of four equations that determine the amplitude, phase, and frequency of a given harmonic in the harmonic noise. Hence, NGE can produce frequency estimates for all harmonics. Our improved estimator uses a suitable linear combination of these NGE frequency estimates to produce a more accurate estimate of the fundamental frequency. Our method is more accurate than NGE, and its accuracy is comparable to least-squares estimation (LSE). The advantage of our method is that it is about two times faster than LSE. This speed gain can become valuable when processing large magnetotelluric (MT) data records. Applying our method to the restoration of MT data, we found that the harmonic noise amplitude in the periodogram is reduced by at least 60 dB to a level below that of MT data.",10.1190/1.2159063
Processing Of Anisotropic Data In The Τ-P Domain: Ii — Common-Conversion-Point Sorting,"Common-conversion-point (CCP) sorting of P-SV converted-wave data is conventionally done by first sorting data into common asymptotic-conversion-point (CACP) gathers and then computing the involved CCP shifts from analytic approximations. I explore an alternative method where the latter step is replaced by an entirely data-driven approach. Moveout curves of correlated P-P and P-SV reflections in collocated CMP and CACP gathers are first scanned for points of equal slowness. A common-source slowness indicates that the downgoing branches of the P-P and P-SV waves overlap if the conversion occurs at the reflecting interface. The P-SV conversion point is then assumed to be situated underneath the associated P-P wave midpoint. A migration of amplitudes from CACP to CCP gathers is straightforward once the exact CCP position is known. This data-driven approach requires kinematic information only and is exact for laterally homogeneous media with arbitrary strength of anisotropy if horizontal symmetry planes are present at all depths. Both time-offset and τ-p domain implementations are possible, although the latter are preferred.",10.1190/1.1993708
An Example Of The Use Of Synthetic Seismograms,"From an actual example taken from the Paris Basin, it is shown how the comparison between field records and synthetic records can be used to ascertain the existence of a potential reservoir for oil and gas. The seismic survey programmed had two main objectives: (1) to define the deep structure which could be presumed from the surface geological measurements, and (2) to obtain stratigraphic data on the structural anomalies of the existence or nonexistence of a reservoir in the Lias series. Two tests drilled independent of geological surveying had revealed a significant truncation in this series. The analysis of the recordings presented was guided by a detailed study of that stratigraphic data. The synthetic records computed for the two tests drilled formed the basis of the correlations. A third test drilled on the structure, after the geophysical survey, permitted verification of the conclusion. During the field work, a special type of recording apparatus was used, underlining the advantages of synthetic seismograms for subsurface problems of this nature.",10.1190/1.1439282
Focusing In Dip And Ava Compensation On Scattering‐Angle/Azimuth Common Image Gathers,"The algorithms are developed for inhomogeneous anisotropic elastic media, but they have so far only been tested on imaging‐inversion of PP and PS reflected waves in an isotropic elastic medium. This was done on two synthetic datasets generated by finite‐difference modeling and ocean‐bottom seismic (OBS) data from the Valhall field. We show that by performing the imaging of the real OBS data in the angle domain, it is possible to construct a well‐focused PP image of the Valhall reservoir directly beneath the ""gas cloud"" in the overburden.",10.1190/1.1543210
Quantitative Interpretation Of Vertical Magnetic Anomalies Over Veins,"By using ordinary magnetic induction methods of analysis, Haalck, Heiland, and others have developed formulas which express the magnetic anomaly over a vertical or inclined vein of tabular shape as a function of the susceptibility, dimensions, shape, and disposition of the vein, and of the strength and direction of the earth's magnetic field. On the basis of these fundamental formulas, other formulas for the vertical component of the magnetic field are derived in the present paper for such veins in intermediate northern magnetic latitudes. Special emphasis is given to the orientation of the veins relative to the magnetic north direction. Several families of vertical magnetic intensity curves for veins with different strikes and dips are given. All theoretical curves for veins striking magnetic north are plotted in terms of a parametric unit so that, once plotted, they can be used repeatedly in different districts, provided a proper multiplying factor is chosen for the observed curve. The importance of the transverse horizontal magnetization effect under certain conditions of orientation is demonstrated. It is shown mathematically that small vertical magnetic anomalies are to be expected for thin veins striking east and dipping south at an angle equal to, or approximately equal to, the complement of the angle of magnetic inclination.",10.1190/1.1437631
Fluid Substitution In Multimineralic Rocks With Large Mineral Stiffness Contrast,"Brown and Korringa extended Gassmann's fluid substitution relation for bulk modulus to multimineralic rocks with interconnected pores. Their strikingly simple yet general result requires two additional bulk stiffnesses, which despite mathematical elegance, are less intuitive than those required by Gassmann. This creates a practical problem, so much so that even though virtually all rocks are multimineralic, in practice, Brown and Korringa's result is seldom used. We revisited this fluid substitution problem and obtained an exact relation for the bulk modulus, which, much like Brown and Korringa's result, required two additional bulk stiffnesses. Although fundamentally identical to Brown and Korringa, our exact solution algebraically differs from Brown and Korringa's result, and features two different additional bulk stiffnesses. This reformulation of Brown and Korringa's result led to strict constraints and new approximations for fluid substitution. Estimates using these new approximations spanned a range that quantified the uncertainty associated with performing fluid substitution when mineral distribution is unknown. We found that this uncertainty was insignificant if the stiffness contrast between different minerals was sufficiently small. For the examples considered, this was true when the stiffness ratio between soft and stiff minerals approached 0.4. When the mineral stiffness contrast was large, we developed a new recipe for fluid substitution, which significantly improved on using the conventional approach of Gassmann with Voigt-Reuss-Hill or Hashin-Shtrikman averaging for minerals in the rock matrix.",10.1190/geo2014-0309.1
Processing Of Seismic Data In The Presence Of Anisotropy,"Processing techniques for extracting the polarization directions of the fast, and slower split shear waves, together with their traveltime splitting from vector wavefield data, form the basis of prospective procedures for imaging details of the internal structure of subsurface rocks. A recently developed technique involving the independent rotation of the source polarization direction, and geophone axes, provides an effective processing tool for extracting the effects of anisotropy from shear‐wave data. It is theoretically capable of handling nonorthogonal polarization directions of split shear waves. It is further developed, and its performance examined using vertical seismic profiling (VSP) shear‐wave datasets for different anisotropic earth models, and computed using full‐wave modeling. The procedure works well for shear waves propagating through an earth model with a uniform crack strike with depth, but produces inaccurate estimates of polarization and time‐delay when the crack strike varies abruptly with depth. It is unlikely that other techniques could do better under these circumstances, as the problems arise due to the complexities introduced by multiple shear‐wave splitting.",10.1190/1.1443153
A New Shipboard Three‐Component Magnetometer,"The three components of the geomagnetic field were measured at sea by STCM (Shipboard Three Component Magnetometer) with a relative accuracy of 50 ± 25 nT. The STCM was controlled by a microcomputer, and the three geomagnetic components were calculated by reducing the magnetic field due to the ship's remanent and induced magnetic moments, the only assumption being that the magnetic field is linearly related to the magnetic moments. Although STCM has no particular magnetic compensation device, it can be set at any place on board of any kind of ship. In the KH82-5 cruise, the three component measurements were conducted along latitude 42 °N north of the Mendocino fracture zone where there are well‐defined magnetic anomaly lineations trending north and south. STCM measured the north component anomalies with very small amplitudes compared to the east and downward component anomalies, which shows that lineations trend north and south. The three measured component anomalies are almost identical to the anomalies calculated from the well‐established time scale; thus, STCM measures the three components correctly. The vector geomagnetic measurements are more useful for analysis of marine geomagnetic anomalies than are the total‐intensity measurements. The DELPWAKASHIO 84/1 cruises provide good examples for examination of the linearity of magnetic anomalies on a single track by using the Fourier transform of the horizontal and vertical component anomalies.",10.1190/1.1442054
Analysis Of A Gas Hydrate Off Southwest Mexico Using Seismic Processing Techniques And Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 66 Results,Analysis of a reprocessed seismic reflection line and results from Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 66 off the southwest coast of Mexico reveal a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) associated with the equilibrium phase boundary of methane hydrate. Several seismic processing techniques were used to accentuate the lateral continuity of the BSR and to delineate the top and base of a 200-700 m thick concentrated hydrate layer. These results suggest the concentrated hydrate layer extends about 20 km parallel to the slope of the inner trench wall in water depths ranging from 2 250-4 500 m. Direct seismic indicators below the BSR and geochemical evidence imply small amounts of free gas may be trapped beneath the base of the hydrate layer and suggest that low‐permeability hydrated sediments can act as a seal for reservoirs.,10.1190/1.1441830
Computer Data Processing And Quantitative Interpretation Of Airborne Resistivity Surveys,"The recently constructed airborne electromagnetic system called E-Phase measures the intensity of the vertical and horizontal electric fields. Standard broadcasting, VLF, and LF navigation aid transmitters are used as sources of the primary EM field. A system of this kind responds best to horizontal layers of large extent and therefore is suitable for geologic mapping and for the detection of resistive materials such as gravel and permafrost. A successful application of the system would not have been possible without digital recording of the data and subsequent computer processing. An efficient algorithm consisting of three processing steps assures low processing cost and provides for two intermediate data checks. Final outputs are printer plots of apparent resistivity for all flight lines and maps of stacked profiles or contours. Quantitative interpretation was made possible by the simultaneous recording of the data at three transmitter frequencies and by the availability of theoretical solutions for layered media. Instead of generating an atlas of type curves, an interactive program was written which enables the geophysicist to rapidly obtain apparent resistivities assuming a three‐layer model. A close match with the measured data is easy to achieve when a reasonable estimate of two of the parameters (resistivities, thicknesses) can be made initially. The interpretation procedure is demonstrated on a case history, a 1973 survey conducted near Wadena, Saskatchewan.",10.1190/1.1440570
The Calculation Of Total‐Intensity Magnetic Anomalies For Certain Bodies By Digital Computer,A method has been devised for calculating total‐intensity magnetic anomalies caused by bodies of finite and infinite thickness. It involves the computer summation of point‐function‐cell area products. Magnetic effects for differently‐shaped bodies are computed by ordering appropriate changes in component cell configurations.,10.1190/1.1439332
Fracture Mapping Using Seismic Amplitude Variation With Offset And Azimuth Analysis At The Weyburn Co2 Storage Site,"Cap rock integrity is an essential characteristic of any reservoir to be used for long-term CO2 storage. Seismic AVOA (amplitude variation with offset and azimuth) techniques have been applied to map HTI anisotropy near the cap rock of the Weyburn field in southeast Saskatchewan, Canada, with the purpose of identifying potential fracture zones that may compromise seal integrity. This analysis, supported by modeling, observes the top of the regional seal (Watrous Formation) to have low levels of HTI anisotropy, whereas the reservoir cap rock (composite Midale Evaporite and Ratcliffe Beds) contains isolated areas of high intensity anisotropy, which may be fracture-related. Properties of the fracture fill and hydraulic conductivity within the inferred fracture zones are not constrained using this technique. The predominant orientations of the observed anisotropy are parallel and normal to the direction of maximum horizontal stress (northeast–southwest) and agree closely with previous fracture studies on core samples from the reservoir. Anisotropy anomalies are observed to correlate spatially with salt dissolution structures in the cap rock and overlying horizons as interpreted from 3D seismic cross sections.",10.1190/geo2011-0075.1
"Electromagnetic Induction In A Generalized 3D Anisotropic Earth, Part 2: The Lin Preconditioner","A practical limitation in the use of generalized 3D forward modeling algorithms for inversion of electromagnetic data is the high computational cost of solving large, ill‐conditioned systems of linear equations arising from the discretization of the governing Maxwell equations. To address this problem, a new class of preconditioners has recently been proposed which is based on a Helmholtz decomposition of the electric field in the low induction number (LIN) regime. This paper further develops that idea and introduces a LIN preconditioner which can be applied to problems characterized by a fully generalized anisotropic medium. Included are sample calculations demonstrating a reduction by two orders of magnitude in the number of ""quasi‐minimal residual"" iterates and a speedup by a factor of approximately four in the solution time for one forward calculation. Also included are results previously unobtainable by standard Jacobi preconditioning for simulating multicomponent induction sonde response in a horizontal well within a crossbedded formation.",10.1190/1.1581044
Elastic Waves In Finely Layered Sediments: The Equivalent Medium And Generalized O'Doherty‐Anstey Formulas,"We study the influence of elastic 1-D inhomogeneous random media (e.g., finely layered media with variable density and shear and compressional velocities) on the kinematics and dynamics of the transmitted obliquely incident P‐ and SV‐plane waves. Multiple scattering (resulting in localization and spatial dispersion of the elastic wavefield) is the main physical effect controlling the properties of the wavefield in such media. We analyze the wave propagation assuming the fluctuations of velocities and density to be small (of the order of 20% or smaller). We obtain explicit analytic solutions for the attenuation coefficient and phase velocity of the transmitted waves. These solutions are valid for all frequencies. They agree very well with results of numerical modeling. Our theory shows that fine elastic multilayering is characterized by a frequency‐dependent anisotropy. At typical acquisition frequencies this anisotropy differs significantly from the low‐frequency anisotropy described by the well‐known Backus averaging. The increase of the phase velocity with frequency is quantified. It can partly explain the difference between well‐log‐derived velocities and lower frequency seismic velocities [e.g., vertical seismic profiling (VSP) velocities] in terms of localization. The low‐ and high‐frequency asymptotical results for the phase velocity agree with those of Backus averaging and ray approximation, respectively. The theory describes the angle‐dependent attenuation caused by multiple scattering. The proposed formulas are simple enough to be used in many practical applications as, e.g., in an amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis. They can be implemented for taking into account the angle dependence of transmission effects, or they can be used in an inversion for statistical parameters of sediments.",10.1190/1.1444052
Direct Method For Determining Constant Corrections To Geophysical Survey Lines For Reducing Mis‐Ties,"A least‐squares method of minimizing mis‐ties in geophysical surveys yields a simple, direct method for determining constant corrections along each crossing survey line. This ""direct method"" is a special case of the more general, orthogonal polynomial method of Foster et al. (1970). The constant corrections are determined directly from the observed data, eliminating the need to iterate or invert a matrix to determine the corrections as in previously published, constant‐correction algorithms. The magnitude of the constant correction to the field values along a particular line equals the difference between the mean mis‐tie value for that line and one‐half the mean mis‐tie for the entire survey. The method minimizes both the mis‐ties and the distortion of the original survey; namely, the mean squared mis‐tie for the entire survey and the mean squared corrections are both minimized. Application of the direct method to test cases in which known errors are added to known ""true"" field values along survey lines in an (x, y) plane indicates that (1) the mis‐ties are completely eliminated if their functional form contains only terms which are functions of either x or y, regardless of the functional form of the errors themselves, (2) the method preserves both the relative field values along the survey lines and the original mean error of the survey, (3) the corrections are independent of the true field, (4) errors common to both intersecting lines will remain in the final map, and (5) the resulting corrected field is not necessarily a more accurate representation of the ""true"" field even when the mis‐ties are completely eliminated.",10.1190/1.1442903
An Amplitude-Based Multiazimuthal Approach To Mapping Fractures Using P-Wave 3D Seismic Data,The technique described in this paper can operate on any 3D P-wave seismic data with wide azimuth and offset distributions.,10.1190/1.1759455
Discussion On: Lateral Velocity Variations Near Boreholes,"The requirement that integrated vertical times from a continuous velocity log check to within some small percent the vertical times computed from the observed travel times of a geophone survey in the same borehole is to me unreasonable. Although we geophysicists know that there are inherent errors in the results of geophone surveys because of possible errors in weathering velocity corrections, datum velocity corrections, depth of shot corrections, and especially seismic travel‐path assumptions, we have presumed the cumulative error in all but unusual surveys to be within the limits of accuracy of reflection seismograph interpretation. The usual seismic travel path assumption, particularly in areas of high velocity stringers or velocity inversions, can be very treacherous in the computation of vertical times. Consequently, I cannot understand why some of our colleagues insist that the log results are incorrect unless they check very closely with the computed vertical shot times. Maybe the computed times are wrong!",10.1190/1.1438611
Tomographic Inversion By Matrix Transformation,"We have developed a new method to build seismic velocity models for complex structures. In our approach, we use a spatially nonuniform parameterization of the velocity model in tomography and a uniform grid representation of the same velocity model in ray tracing to generate the linear system of tomographic equations. Subsequently, a matrix transformation is applied to the system of equations to produce a new linear system of tomographic equations using nonuniform parameterization. In this way, we improved the stability of tomographic inversion without adding computing costs. We tested the effectiveness of our process on a 3D synthetic data example.",10.1190/1.2963496
Feasibility Of Simplified Integral Equation Modeling Of Low-Frequency Marine Csem With A Resistive Target,"We have assessed the accuracy of a simplified integral equation (SIE) modeling approach for marine controlled-source electromagnetics (CSEM) with low applied frequencies and a resistive target. The most computationally intensive part of rigorous integral equation (IE) modeling is the computation of the anomalous electric field within the target itself. This leads to a matrix problem with a dense coefficient matrix. It is well known that, in general, the presence of many grid cells creates a computational disadvantage for dense-matrix methods compared to sparse-matrix methods. The SIE approach replaces the dense-matrix part of rigorous IE modeling by sparse-matrix calculations based on an approximation of Maxwell's equations. The approximation is justified theoretically if a certain dimensionless parameter  β  is small. As opposed to approximations of the Born type, the validity of the SIE approach does not rely on the anomalous field to be small in comparison with the background field in the target region. We have calculated  β  for a range of parameter values typical for marine CSEM, and compared the SIE approach numerically to the rigorous IE method and to the quasi-linear (QL) and quasi-analytic (QA) approximate solutions. It is found that the SIE approach is very accurate for small  β , corresponding to frequencies in the lower range of those typical for marine CSEM for petroleum exploration. In addition, the SIE approach is found to be significantly more accurate than the QL and QA approximations for small  β .",10.1190/1.3192910
The Radon Transform And Its Properties,"This paper presents a summary of the fundamental properties of the Radon transform, including delay effects, data shifting, rotation, scaling, windowing, bowtie events, energy conservation, etc., and includes representative examples on standard data sets such as 2-D delta functions, boxcar events, Gaussian bell, and conic sections which reinforce the basic concepts of the Radon transform.",10.1190/1.1441747
Quantitative Interpretation Of Input Aem Measurements,"Recent improvements of the INPUT airborne electromagnetic system have made possible a more quantitative approach to interpretation. The necessary interpretational aids can be obtained  in two ways: either by correlating the system  and ground EM measurements, or by devising  computational or analog quantitative models. Both approaches have been explored. In the former, the system decay rate can be correlated with the apparent conductivity‐thickness (σt) estimated by ground surveys. In the latter, four quantitative models were investigated, vertical half‐plane, vertical ribbon, dipping half‐plane, and homogeneous half‐space. Nomograms have been constructed which make it possible to determine  σt, conductor depth, and dip for sheet‐like conductors, and conductivity for a homogeneous half‐space. Field examples show that this procedure  can be used satisfactorily in the routine interpretation of records obtained by this system.",10.1190/1.1440401
Characterizing An Unstable Mountain Slope Using Shallow 2D And 3D Seismic Tomography,"As transport routes and population centers in mountainous areas expand, risks associated with rockfalls and rockslides grow at an alarming rate. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to delineate mountain slopes susceptible to catastrophic collapse in a safe and noninvasive manner. For this purpose, we have developed a 3D tomographic seismic refraction technique and applied it to an unstable alpine mountain slope, a significant segment of which is moving at   0.01–0.02 m∕year   toward the adjacent valley floor. First arrivals recorded across an extensive region of the exposed gneissic rock mass have extraordinarily low apparent velocities at short   (0.2 m)   to long   (100 m)   shot-receiver offsets. Inversion of the first-arrival traveltimes produces a 3D tomogram that reveals the presence of a huge volume of very-low-quality rock with ultralow to very low P-wave velocities of   500–2700 m∕s  . These values are astonishingly low compared to the average horizontal P-wave velocity of   5400 m∕s   determined from laboratory analyses of intact rocks collected at the investigation site. The extremely low field velocities likely result from the ubiquitous presence of dry cracks, fracture zones, and faults on a wide variety of scales. They extend to more than   35 m   depth over a   200×150-m   area that encompasses the mobile segment of the mountain slope, which is transected by a number of actively opening fracture zones and faults, and a large part of the adjacent stationary slope. Although hazards related to the mobile segment have been recognized since the last major rockslides affected the mountain in 1991, those related to the adjacent low-quality stationary rock mass have not.",10.1190/1.2338823
Time-Lapse Magnetotelluric Monitoring Of An Enhanced Geothermal System,"Realization of enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) prescribes the need for novel methods to monitor subsurface fracture connectivity and fluid distribution. Magnetotellurics (MT) is a passive electromagnetic (EM) method sensitive to electrical conductivity contrasts as a function of depth, specifically hot saline fluids in a resistive porous media. In July 2011, an EGS fluid injection at 3.6-km depth near Paralana, South Australia, was monitored by comparing repeated MT surveys before and after hydraulic stimulation. An observable coherent change above measurement error in the MT response was present and causal, in that variations in phase predict variations in apparent resistivity. Phase tensor residuals proved the most useful representation for characterizing alterations in subsurface resistivity structure, whereas resistivity tensor residuals aided in determining the sign and amplitude of resistivity variations. These two tensor representations of the residual MT response suggested fluids migrated toward the northeast of the injection well along an existing fault system trending north-northeast. Forward modeling and concurrent microseismic data support these results, although microseismic data suggest fractures opened along two existing fracture networks trending north-northeast and northeast. This exemplifies the need to use EM methods for monitoring fluid injections due to their sensitivity to conductivity contrasts.",10.1190/geo2012-0275.1
On The Effect Of Recording Aperture In Migration Of Vertical Seismic Profile Data,"Miller et al. (1984) presents examples of different images of a pattern of point diffractors obtained by migrating data from various sources and receivers. In particular, they consider combinations of vertical seismic profile (VSP) and surface survey data. Related VSP studies by Kohler and Koenig (1984), Hu and McMechan (1986), Chang and McMechan (1986), and by Sun and McMechan (1986) suggest the importance of multiple offsets for imaging of complicated structures in VSP experiments. The key point is similar to that made by Berkhout (1980), namely, image resolution varies directly with recording aperture. Physically, of course, reconstruction of a structural image by migration can utilize only those waves that were recorded. Partial data produce partial images.",10.1190/1.1442056
Application Of The Pocs Inversion Method To Cross‐Borehole Imaging,"Cross‐borehole tomography suffers from a well‐known problem of data incompleteness: the limited ray coverage dictated by the poor experimental geometry implies that certain features of the velocity field are not determined by the data. Construction of a tomographic image of the velocity field therefore requires the addition of prior constraints to the inversion. In the Fourier wavenumber domain (assuming straight‐line rays), the process of adding prior constraints is equivalent to specifying unmeasured wavenumber coefficients. The projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm can impose physically plausible constraints that allow high quality tomographic images to be produced. Each constraint is viewed as defining a set (in function space) of images that satisfy that particular constraint. The POCS method finds one or more images in the intersection of the constraining sets, which is equivalent to finding an image that simutaneously satisfies a number of constraints including the observed data. The sets of images that we employ include: those that satisfy the data in the sense of having certain known wavenumber components, those that have bounded energy in certain unmeasured wavenumber components, those that have seismic velocity bounded everywhere (e.g., non‐negative), and those in which the velocity structure is confined to the region between the boreholes. An advantage of the POCS algorithm is that it allows both space‐domain and wavenumber‐domain constraints to be imposed simultaneously. In our implementation of the POCS algorithm, we make use of the fast Fourier transform to rapidly iterate between the space and Fourier‐wavenumber domains. We test the method on synthetic data, and show that it significantly reduces the artifacts in the image, when compared to other methods. We then apply it to data from a cross‐borehole experiment in Manitoba, Canada, that were previously studied by others. We achieve a tomographic image of the velocity field that is similar in many respects to the results of others, but which possesses fewer artifacts.",10.1190/1.1443485
Crosshole Seismoelectric Measurements In Borehole Models With Fractures,"Laboratory experiments are performed in cross‐borehole models with fractures to investigate seismoelectric conversions in the fractures. Using an electrode in a borehole, we measure the electric field induced by an acoustic wave, and we investigate the relationship between the electric signal and the fracture aperture using ultrasonic fracture borehole models. The experimental results confirm that a radiating electromagnetic (EM) wave is induced by a guide wave at a fracture between an acoustic source and electric receiver boreholes. The position of a vertical or inclined fracture between two boreholes can be determined using the arrival times of the EM wave and the formation velocity by placing the acoustic source at a different depth and recording electric signals with real or synthetic arrays of acoustic and electric receivers in the second borehole. Crosshole seismoelectric measurements might be a technique for investigating fractures between boreholes more directly than traditional acoustic measurements.",10.1190/1.1620625
"Geophysical History Of The Iowa Field, Calcasieu And Jefferson Davis Parishes, Louisiana","The discovery well of the Iowa field was drilled in October of 1931, and the field has produced 48,000,000 barrels of oil to date. The history of the early refraction seismograph, gravity, and reflection seismograph exploration of this important field is presented.",10.1190/1.1445055
Multiple Attenuation In The Image Space,"Multiples can be suppressed in the angle-domain image space after migration. For a given velocity model, primaries and multiples have different angle-domain moveout and, therefore, can be separated using techniques similar to the ones employed in the data space prior to migration. We use Radon transforms in the image space to discriminate between primaries and multiples and employ accurate functions describing angle-domain moveouts. Since every individual angle-domain common-image gather incorporates complex 3D propagation effects, our method has the advantage of working with 3D data and complicated geology. Therefore, our method offers an alternative to the more expensive surface-related multiple-elimination (SRME) approach operating in the data space. Radon transforms are cheap but not necessarily ideal for separating primaries and multiples, particularly at small angles where the moveout discrepancy between the two kinds of events are not large. Better techniques involving signal/noise separation using prediction-error filters can be employed as well, although such approaches fall outside the scope of this paper. We demonstrate, using synthetic and real data examples, the power of our method in discriminating between primaries and multiples after migration by wavefield extrapolation, followed by transformation to the angle domain.",10.1190/1.1852789
Conductivity Spectra Of Rocks From The Craigmont Ore Environment,"The conductivities of rocks of a suite from the Craigmont ore environment were studied as functions of frequency over the four decades 1,000 to 0.1 cps. The following were observed on a plot of linear conductivity vs log frequency. (1) Rocks mineralized with disseminated sulfides and magnetite yield low‐to‐moderate induced polarization (I.P.) and have conductivity‐frequency spectra which are concave‐up. (2) As veining increases, the spectra tend to straighten, and become sensibly straight when much of the metallics are interconnected; such rocks are characterized by low to large I.P. (3) Massive specular hematite cores yield a large I.P. and have spectra which are markedly concave‐up. For comparison, (4) clay‐containing sandstones yield low to moderate I.P. and have spectra which are slightly convex‐up. Consequently, the combination of I.P. magnitude and spectral analysis permits distinction of the various mineralization types.",10.1190/1.1439425
Gpr Characterization Of Buried Tanks And Pipes,"Ray‐based numerical simulations of monostatic and bistatic GPR responses for several tank and pipe configurations reveal the potential for noninvasive diagnostic evaluations. Examples include discrimination of the material from which a tank is constructed, its size, contents, fluid levels, and shape changes. Ambiguities occur when different configurations give similar responses, and evaluations become less reliable as noise increases. Simulations are able to reproduce the salient features of field GPR data recorded over a metal pipe, and over plastic pipes filled with air, fresh water, and salt water.",10.1190/1.1444189
Fluid Distribution Effect On Sonic Attenuation In Partially Saturated Limestones,"Extensional and torsional wave‐attenuation measurements are obtained at a sonic frequency around 1 kHz on partially saturated limestones using large resonant bars, 1 m long. To study the influence of the fluid distribution, we use two different saturation methods: drying and depressurization. When water saturation (Sw) is higher than 70%, the extensional wave attenuation is found to depend on whether the resonant bar is jacketed. This can be interpreted as the Biot‐Gardner‐White effect. The experimental results obtained on jacketed samples show that, during a drying experiment, extensional wave attenuation is influenced strongly by the fluid content when Sw is between approximately 60% and 100%. This sensitivity to fluid saturation vanishes when saturation is obtained through depressurization. Using a computer‐assisted tomographic (CT) scan, we found that, during depressurization, the fluid distribution is homogeneous at the millimetric scale at all saturations. In contrast, during drying, heterogeneous saturation was observed at high water‐saturation levels. Thus, we interpret the dependence of the extensional wave attenuation upon the saturation method as principally caused by a fluid distribution effect. Torsional attenuation shows no sensitivity to fluid saturation for Sw between 5% and 100%.",10.1190/1.1444308
Application Of The Recursive‐Approaching Signal Filter (Rasf) To Vsp Data Processing,"The recursive‐approaching signal filter (RASF) is a newly developed filtering technique that combines many advantages of linear, nonlinear, and adaptive filters. It passes step functions without altering them and removes many types of noise, such as Gaussian and Laplacian distributed noise. When applied to VSP data processing, the RASF emphasizes those abrupt discontinuities that originate or terminate at discrete depth points and effectively accomplishes the separation of upgoing and downgoing wave modes. The RASF may be transformed into a desired filter by simply changing a parameter to achieve the maximum usefulness of VSP field data. In the tests with the synthetic VSP modeling data corrupted by white Gaussian noise and real VSP data, the RASF compares favorably to f-k velocity and median filtering methods in removing noise, preserving step functions, and computational simplicity.",10.1190/1.1444207
Static Shift Of Magnetotelluric Data And Its Removal In A Sedimentary Basin Environment,"Previous modeling investigations of the static shift of magnetotelluric (MT) apparent resistivity curves have limited appeal in that the electric fields used were point measurements, whereas field observations are of voltage differences. Thus, inhomogeneities of dimension of the order of the electrode line length could not be investigated. In this paper, by using a modeling algorithm that derives point voltages rather than point electric fields, I consider the effect on the MT responses of local near‐surface distorting structures, which are both outside of, and inside, the telluric electrode array. I show that static‐shift effects are of larger spatial size but of less magnitude than would be expected from conventional modeling. Also, the field observation that static shift affects only the apparent resistivity curve but not the phase response can be replicated by the voltage difference modeling. If there exists within the earth a layer whose variation in electrical resistivity along the profile can be treated in a parametric fashion, then static shift of the apparent resistivity curves can be corrected. Deriving the modal value from a sufficient number of observations for the layer resistivity is the most useful approach.",10.1190/1.1442533

Improvements In Seismic Prospecting In 1938,"Improvements in reflection seismographs have been made during the past two or three years which have made it possible to use the method in areas previously considered unworkable. But these are not developments of the current year. The developments were worked out in regular seismograph country in the recent past, and the note‐worthy thing for this year is that they have now been applied successfully for the first time to areas which seismologists abandoned four or five years ago as unworkable.",10.1190/1.1440487
Structure Mapping On Enhanced Landsat Images Of Southern Brazil: Tectonic Control Of Mineralization And Speculations On Metallogeny,"Computer enhancement, particularly contrast‐stretching, reveals a previously unnoticed east‐west structural zone across a Landsat image of the southern Brazilian Precambrian shield. In this zone occur the only known economic or near‐economic deposits of gold, tin, and copper. Such deposits are typically localized by small east‐west structural elements. Non‐economic copper occurrences elsewhere in the region appear to be related to major northeast‐ and northwest‐trending lineaments mapped on Landsat images. Mineral exploration should be primarily directed at the main east‐west lineament, but two other possible east‐west zones might be worthwhile targets also. The major east‐west lineament projects through a break in the continental shelf, across the Atlantic along a large transoceanic fracture zone and into the African continent along a mapped tectonic trend that goes through an area that produces copper, gold, and tin. Global geophysical data suggest that the mapped east‐west trend in South America is a surface reflection of structures that developed in the tectosphere in Precambrian time and that have persisted until the present.",10.1190/1.1440720
Automatic Determination Of Depth On Aeromagnetic Profiles,"In our method of determining depths from aeromagnetic profile data, several sampling intervals adapted to the possible ranges of depths are used for a preliminary analysis of the profiles. This step detects and locates all the anomalies. We then study each anomaly in detail, using several structural hypotheses such as bottomless prisms (dikes) and thin plates. In this way, we produce a series of theoretical structures for each anomaly; only the best‐fitting ones are kept. Our results are shown as a distance‐depth representation, with the symbols plotted so as to indicate the probable degree of realiability. The complete processing is done automatically by a computer and a plotter.",10.1190/1.1440207
Seismic Imaging Of The Naga Thrust Using Multiscale Waveform Inversion,"This case study images the structural features related to the Naga thrust fault (northeast India) using a combination of multiscale waveform inversion and prestack depth migration (PSDM). The waveform model and the PSDM image complement each other: the former provides a physical-property map (P-wave velocity model) and the latter provides a structural image. The velocity model encompassing the starting model for waveform inversion is constructed using joint inversion of first and reflected traveltimes. The   4–8-Hz   data are inverted consecutively in   1-Hz   bandwidths to yield the final waveform model, which in turn is used for PSDM. The PSDM image and the waveform model are consistent with the lithological interpretation of an inline exploratory well. When interpreted jointly, the PSDM image and the waveform model reveal the presence of a conjugate fault system in the Naga thrust and fold belt.",10.1190/1.3158602
A New Multicoil Aerial Electromagnetic Prospecting System,"A helicopter‐towed multicoil electromagnetic system was developed using a 30‐ft bird and a transmitted frequency of 918 Hz. Its primary features of interest are (1) low aerodynamic and geological noise, (2) three‐dimensional vector recording of anomalies, and (3) quantity of geological information which is extracted by a computer‐oriented interpretive procedure. The multicoil system‐was developed to obtain more diagnostic geologic information about a conductor than was possible with other aerial electromagnetic equipment. This led to two approaches: (1) three‐dimensional recording of anomalies was developed to provide information on the electrical current distribution within the conductor and, hence, on the geometry of the conductor and (2) high‐resolution, low‐frequency design was chosen to bias the response of the system toward high‐conductivity targets to minimize interference from the usual geologic noise sources, thereby enhancing the response of discrete massive sulfide conductors. A consequence of these design criteria is a system yielding an advance in the state‐of‐the‐art of aerial electromagnetic exploration.",10.1190/1.1440277
On The Reflection And Transmission Of Viscoelastic Waves—Some Numerical Results,"The mathematical theory which is typically used to model the intrinsic anelasticity of the earth is the linear theory of viscoelasticity. The effects of anelasticity on wave propagation, such as absorption and dispersion, are often described using one‐dimensional (1-D) plane waves of the form exp[i(ωt-kx)] with k complex and frequency‐dependent. These waves are solutions of the 1-D viscoelastic wave equation. The reflection and transmission of plane waves in a layered viscoelastic medium is, however, a 2-D or 3-D problem. The solutions to the 2-D or 3-D viscoelastic wave equation are the so‐called general plane waves, which are classified as homogeneous or inhomogeneous depending upon whether or not the planes of constant phase, i.e., wavefronts, coincide with the planes of constant amplitude (the 1-D plane waves mentioned above are strictly homogeneous).",10.1190/1.1441765
A Method For Estimating Apparent Displacement Vectors From Time-Lapse Seismic Images,"Reliable estimates of vertical, inline, and crossline components of apparent displacements in time-lapse seismic images are difficult to obtain for two reasons. First, features in 3D seismic images tend to be locally planar, and components of displacement within the planes of such features are poorly resolved. Second, searching directly for peaks in 3D crosscorrelations is less robust, more complicated, and computationally more costly than searching for peaks of 1D crosscorrelations. I estimate all three components of displacement with a process designed to mitigate these two problems. I address the first problem by computing for each image sample a local phase correlation instead of a local crosscorrelation. I address the second problem with a cyclic sequence of searches for peaks of correlations computed for lags constrained to one of the three image axes.",10.1190/1.3184015
Developments In A Model To Describe Low‐Frequency Electrical Polarization Of Rocks,"The author reworks his total current conductivity function introduced in a previous paper, related to electrical polarization of rocks in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10−3 Hz. The original five parameters in this function are replaced by new ones, which from the beginning have clear petrophysical and electrochemical meanings and well‐defined ranges of variation. Some classical models are derived as particular cases of it. The main existing models proposed to describe induced polarization (IP) are analyzed, and most of them are grouped together under a common circuit analog representation and a respective generating function. A circuit analog is assigned to each model. The multi‐Cole‐Cole model circuit analog reveals intrinsic constraints involving the values of its circuit elements. Because of these constraint relations and the relaxation times ratio (τ1/τ2)—usually many orders of magnitude from unity—the model has no physical validation to represent single‐phase material systems (in the sense of the polarization). The performance and analysis of the various models to describe a few well‐selected experimental data show that only two of the models, the multi‐Cole‐Cole and Dias models, can provide a function structure capable of fitting these data. This fact, the associated petrophysical interpretation consistency, and the basic characteristics of these two models, such as the way they were derived (empirically, the former; phenomenologically, the latter) and the number of coefficients in the function (directly related to the degree of ambiguity of their determination), make the author's model attractive and promising.",10.1190/1.1444738
"Gravity Models Of The Albuquerque Basin, Rio Grande Rift, New Mexico","As part of a hydrologic study, gravity anomalies over the Albuquerque basin were modeled to determine the thickness of the low‐density Neogene basin deposits, the major aquifer of the basin. The models are constrained by substantial density log and well data. Fifteen two‐dimensional (2-D) models include four major density units. The upper unit (density 2.20g/cm3) corresponds to the Neogene syn‐rifting deposits. Thickness of this unit averages about 1.5 km and exceeds 2.0 km in a strip along the east side of the basin. The thickness is about 1.0 km between the Albuquerque and the Santo Domingo basins. At the south end of the Albuquerque basin, the thickness is less than 0.5 km. The configuration of the remaining density units, less constrained by well data, raises significant questions about the history of the basin that cannot be answered with existing data.",10.1190/1.1441381
Sobel Filter For Edge Detection Of Hexagonally Sampled 3D Seismic Data,"In today's industry, automatic detection of geologic features such as faults and channels is a challenging problem when the quality of data is not good. Edge detection filters are generally applied for the purpose of locating such features. Until now, edge detection has been carried out on rectangularly sampled 3D seismic data. The computational cost of edge detection can be reduced by exploring other sampling approaches instead of the regular rectangular sampling commonly used. Hexagonal sampling is an alternative to rectangular sampling that requires 13.4% less samples for the same level of accuracy. The hexagonal approach is an efficient method of sampling with greater symmetry compared with the rectangular approach. Spiral architecture can be used to handle the hexagonally sampled seismic data. Spiral architecture is an attractive scheme for handling 2D images that enables processing 2D data as 1D data in addition to the inherent hexagonal sampling advantages. Thus, the savings in number of samples, greater symmetry, and efficient data handling capability makes hexagonal sampling an ideal choice for computationally exhaustive operations. For the first time to our knowledge, we have made an attempt to detect edges in hexagonally sampled seismic data using spiral architecture. We compared edge detection on rectangular and hexagonally sampled seismic data using 2D and 3D filters in rectangular and hexagonal domains. We determined that hexagonal processing results in exceptional computational savings, when compared with its rectangular processing counterpart.",10.1190/geo2015-0495.1
Seismic Modeling With Radial-Basis-Function-Generated Finite Differences,"Presented as a poster at the 2014 SEG Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado.",10.1190/geo2014-0492.1
Asymptotic Theory For Imaging The Attenuation Factor Q,"To describe accurately the propagation of elastic waves for characterizing and monitoring hydrocarbon reservoirs, as well as to obtain improved earth models, it is important to take into account seismic attenuation. We describe a method to estimate anelastic medium properties by a complete SH-waveform inversion. We use an optimization approach based on the iterative minimization of the mismatch between the seismic data and the computed response. To obtain a fast analytical imaging procedure, we include an asymptotic theory for attenuation in a linearized inverse scattering formulation. The forward modeling is solved by the Born approximation for a smooth and attenuative background medium. An asymptotic ray‐tracing method is used to calculate traveltime, amplitude, and attenuation between source, receiver, and scattering points. The resulting method is computationally efficient and allows for a variety of data‐ acquisition geometries, including those with redundant or incomplete source‐receiver coverage. Synthetic examples with realistic surface‐to‐surface geometry show an acceptable convergence in a few iterations when anomaly perturbations are less than 10% of the reference values and when associated diffracting structures are smaller than one‐tenth of the predominant seismic wavelength. Through there remains the fundamental trade‐off between density and shear modulus, the iterative asymptotic inversion is able to recover the elastic parameters (density and shear modulus) and the attenuation factor.",10.1190/1.1444471
Interpretation Of Magnetic Data Using An Enhanced Local Wavenumber (Elw) Method,"This paper presents an enhancement of the local-wavenumber method (named ELW for ""enhanced local wavenumber"") for interpretation of profile magnetic data. This method uses the traditional and phase-rotated local wavenumbers to produce a linear equation as a function of the model parameters. The equation can be solved to determine the horizontal location and depth of a 2D magnetic body without specifying a priori information about the nature of the sources. Using the obtained source-location parameters, the nature of the source can then be inferred. The method was tested using theoretical simulations with random noise over a dike body. It was able to provide both the location and an index characterizing the nature of the source body. The practical utility of the method is demonstrated using field examples over dikelike bodies from Canada and Egypt.",10.1190/1.1884828
Interactive Inversion In Geosciences,"Inversion algorithms numerically evaluate the mismatch between model and data to guide the search for minima in parameter spaces. In an alternative approach, the numerical evaluation of data misfit can be replaced by subjectively judging the solution's quality. This widens the class of problems that can be treated within the framework of formal inverse theory—in particular, various geophysical/geological/geodynamic applications in which structural similarity between model and data determines the quality of the fit. In this situation, prior knowledge, experience, and even personal intuition are crucial. This approach also provides a simple way to include such expertise in more traditional numeric applications, e.g., to treat ambiguous problems and disregard geologically unfeasible solutions from the inverse search.",10.1190/1.1487069
"Integrated Reservoir Study, Lower Eocene Misoa Reservoirs, Vla-6/9/21 Area, Block I, Phase 2, Stage 2, Lagunillas Field, North‐Central Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela","Twenty‐eight geologically targeted, field development opportunities, including a variety of deeper pool opportunities that could significantly add to Maraven's (affiliate of PDVSA) reserve base, are identified in Lower Eocene Misoa reservoirs in the Stage 2 Area in Block I in north‐central Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela with the help of integrated geophysical, geological, petrophysical, and engineering analyses. Seismic rms amplitudes are instrumental in detecting and mapping trends of lithofacies and were integrated into stratigraphic models. Amplitude response to net sand thickness is a linear relationship. The amplitude signature also captures hydrocarbon charge as evidenced by bright amplitudes coincident with structural, fault‐bounded culminations. These direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) can result from as low as 2% miscible gas fraction within the hydrocarbon column.",10.1190/1.1444253
The Development And Applications Of A Wide Band Electromagnetic Sounding System Using A Pseudo‐Noise Source,"A very wide band (0.03 Hz to 15 kHz) electromagnetic (EM) system has been developed. It was used over the band 1 Hz to 10 kHz to determine the electrical structure of the earth's crust from depths of a few meters to over 40 km. A direct current of from 1 to 5 A was reversed through a long wire bipole transmitter in a pseudo‐random binary sequence (PRBS). Depending upon the frequencies selected, a sensitive one‐component flux gate magnetometer or an air‐core coil was used to monitor temporal changes in the vertical component of the magnetic field at a recording site. The measured signal was crosscorrelated digitally in real time with an exact copy of the transmitted waveform in order to obtain a good signal‐to‐noise ratio at distances up to 5 times the length of the bipole. The output crosscorrelogram was deconvolved from the system input, the autocorrelogram of the transmitted waveform, using a Wiener least‐squares filter to give the impulse response of the earth. This was then transformed into frequency domain to yield directly the phase and amplitude transfer function, which was inverted in a routine manner with a Marquardt algorithm to find layer conductivities and thicknesses. Two field experiments are described. The first demonstrates the viability of the technique to sound a simple layered section of interbedded shale and limestone. It was a relatively shallow sounding to a depth of about 500 m in the sedimentary basin of southern Ontario. The second experiment was designed to search for a conductive zone in the lower crust. A bipole over 20 km long carried a transmitter current of only 5 A, yet field data were obtained over the range 35 to 70 km. The primary magnetic fields never exceeded 10 mgamma and were often considerably smaller. The interpretation indicates a conductive layer of resistivity less than 270 Ω-m at a depth of about 20 km.",10.1190/1.1441124
Effect Of Development Time And Developer Temperature On The Production Of Photographic Seismograph Records,"The effect of variation of development time and developer temperature on the production of uniform records is discussed, and a method of determining the relation is shown. Graphs plotted from sensitometric data indicate the need of some means of temperature control.",10.1190/1.1437115
Electrical Analog Approach To Dipmeter Computation,"An electrical analog instrument has been developed to calculate dip and strike from continuous dipmeter logs. The particular model described is designed specifically for the Schlumberger CDM-P, or Poteclinometer, logs and it can be used with hole deviations of up to 36 degrees. Every control on this instrument corresponds to one of the recorded parameters of the dipmeter log. It is thus easy to see the effect of any one parameter on the resolved dip and strike. The instrument is portable and can therefore be used at the well site, if necessary, to make on‐the‐spot decisions regarding further drilling operation after a dipmeter log has been run. No elaborate training in procedure is required. The rapidity with which the computations can be made also permits a larger number of levels to be computed. This frequently results in more accurate information and a considerable saving in computation expense.",10.1190/1.1438773
A Theory For The Regional Correction Of Potential Field Data,"An analytical method based on the theory of statistical probability is developed for separating regional from local potential field effects. It is applied to an objective test on an artificial problem, as well as to a gravity survey that has already been the subject of studies of other averaging methods. It succeeds in both tests with good accuracy, and points up the danger of arbitrariness in the use of numerical methods.",10.1190/1.1437968
"Line Spacing Effect And Determination Of Optimum Spacing Illustrated By Marmora, Ontario Magnetic Anomaly","The airborne magnetometer data of the Marmora iron ore deposit at Marmora, Ontario have been used as an example to show the results obtained by the use of various line spacings ranging from 1 mile to 1/4 mile. The maps show how easy it is, in any type of geophysical survey, to miss a feature of economic value if the line spacing is too coarse. The probability equations are given for the crossing of randomly oriented features whose maximum dimension is less than the spacing of the control lines for circular, elongate, and rectangular outlines. The equations are P=D/S; P=2L/πS; P=2(L+W)/πS; P=A/πS; P=(2L(S+T)-L2)/πST; and P=(D(S+T-πD))/ST; respectively where P is the probability; D is the diameter; L is the length; W is the width; and S and T are line spacings.",10.1190/1.1438197
Simultaneous 1D Inversion Of Loop–Loop Electromagnetic Data For Magnetic Susceptibility And Electrical Conductivity,"We present an algorithm that simultaneously inverts susceptibility‐affected data for 1D conductivity and susceptibility models. The solution is obtained by minimizing an objective function comprised of a sum‐of‐squares measure of data misfit and sum‐of‐squares measures of the amounts of structure in the conductivity and susceptibility models. Positivity of the susceptibilities is enforced by including a logarithmic barrier term in the objective function. The trade‐off parameter is automatically estimated using the generalized cross validation (GCV) criterion. This enables an appropriate fit to the observations to be achieved even if good noise estimates are not available. As well as synthetic examples, we show the results of inverting airborne data sets from Australia and Heath Steele Stratmat, New Brunswick.",10.1190/1.1635038
2-D Gravity Modeling With Analytically Defined Geometry And Quadratic Polynomial Density Functions,"New methods for 2-D modeling of gravity anomaly data are developed following an approach that uses both analytic and numerical methods of integration. The forward‐model solution developed here is suitable to calculate the gravity effect caused by a 2-D source body bounded either laterally or vertically by continuous functions. In our models, the density contrast is defined by a second‐order polynomial function of depth and distance along the profile. We present several examples to show that our models are capable of accommodating a broad variety of geologic structures.",10.1190/1.1444677
Improved Interface Detection For Vertical Seismic Profile Inversion,"Grivelet (1985) presented an interface detection scheme as part of his iterative modeling approach to vertical seismic profile (VSP) inversion. In his scheme and those like it (Dillon, 1985), the interfaces which produce major reflections must be identified for reasons of stability and uniqueness. In general, Grivelet's detection algorithm works well, though it sometimes fails when two events of the same polarity and amplitude overlap. By extending his detection algorithm, we obtain more robust interface detection.",10.1190/1.1442566
Crone Pulse Electromagnetic Response Of A Conducting Thin Horizontal Sheet—Theory And Field Application,"The horizontal, conducting thin‐sheet model represents a special interest in interpretation of electromagnetic field data since it is a suitable interpretation model for the surficial conductive layer, a common occurrence in many terrains. For small thicknesses of overburden layers (⩽.05Tx-Rxseparation) the resolution of layer thickness and conductivity is not possible and interpretation needs to be carried out in terms of the layer conductance. An attractive feature of the thin‐sheet model is the simplicity with which the time‐domain response ",10.1190/1.1442006
Reservoir Characterization Based Upon The Onset Of Time-Lapse Amplitude Changes,"Time-lapse geophysical monitoring has potential as a tool for reservoir characterization, that is, for determining reservoir properties such as permeability. Onset times, the calendar times at which geophysical observations begin to deviate from their initial or background values, provide a useful basis for such characterization. We found that, in contrast to time-lapse amplitude changes, onset times were not sensitive to the exact method used to related changes in fluid saturation to changes in seismic velocities. As a consequence of this, we found that an inversion for effective permeability based upon onset times was robust with respect to variations in the rock-physics model. In particular, inversions of synthetic onset times calculated using Voigt and Reuss averaging techniques, but inverted using sensitivities from Hill's averaging method, resulted in almost identical misfit reductions and similar permeability models. All solutions based on onset times recovered the large-scale, resolvable features of the reference model. Synthetic tests indicated that reliable onset times can be obtained from noisy seismic amplitudes. Testing also indicated that large-scale permeability variations can be recovered even if we used onset times from seismic surveys that were spaced as much as 300 days apart.",10.1190/geo2014-0076.1
Pore Pressure Estimation In Reservoir Rocks From Seismic Reflection Data,"A method is used to obtain pore pressure in shaly sandstones based upon an acoustic model for seismic velocity versus clay content and effective pressure. Calibration of the model requires log data—porosity, clay content, and sonic velocities—to obtain the dry‐rock moduli and the effective stress coefficients as a function of depth and pore pressure. The seismic P‐wave velocity, derived from reflection tomography, is fitted to the theoretical velocity by using pore pressure as the fitting parameter. This approach, based on a rock‐physics model, is an improvement over existing pore‐pressure prediction methods, which mainly rely on empirical relations between velocity and pressure. The method is applied to the Tune field in the Viking Graben sedimentary basin of the North Sea. We have obtained a high‐resolution velocity map that reveals the sensitivity to pore pressure and fluid saturation in the Tarbert reservoir. The velocity map of the Tarbert reservoir and the inverted pressure distribution agree with the structural features of the Tarbert Formation and its known pressure compartments.",10.1190/1.1620631
Moment And Moment Magnitude Of Seismic Events Located By Stacking,"Determination of moment and moment magnitude for seismic events located by stacking has been an unsolved problem because current methodologies cannot be applied. To solve this problem, we have developed a methodology for moment magnitude Mw estimation of (micro) seismic events. Our method was designed for stacking waveforms. We found that magnitude can be determined from the stack of amplitudes corrected for radiation pattern and propagation effects such as geometric spreading, attenuation, and free-surface boundary. From the stack of corrected waveforms, we found the low-frequency limit corresponding to the stack of particle displacement and calculated seismic moment. We found that an unstacked method of estimating moment magnitude on each trace and averaging these estimates was consistent with the method we developed although it was limited to higher magnitude events and more sensitive to noise. We benchmarked our methodology with a case study and found improvement in Mw estimation resulting in determination of magnitude for weaker events when unstacked methodology cannot be used.",10.1190/geo2014-0179.1
"High‐Frequency Reflections In Granite? Delineation Of The Weathering Front In Granodiorite At Piñon Flat, California","We analyze data from two orthogonal seismic lines 336 m in length collected at Piñon Flat, California, over weathered granodiorite bedrock. Each line was made up of 10 reversed segments 84 m in length. We analyzed the first arrivals from these data and found dramatic variations in velocity along the profiles. An upper layer (approximately 2-m thick) known from trenching to be composed of soil and sandy grus had measured velocities ranging from 400 to 700 m/s. Velocities inferred from refraction analysis of first arrivals of the reversed lines revealed a heterogeneous lower layer below the soil with measured velocities of 1600–2700 m/s by a depth of 15 m. We interpret these data to be measuring velocities of a deeply weathered unit characterized by granodiorite corestones embedded in a matrix of saprolite. The most remarkable feature of these data emerged from attempting to process the same data as reflection data. Simple bandpass filtering in the 250–400 Hz band revealed a bright, impulsive arrival with three characteristic properties: (1) irregular velocity moveout that is inconsistent with that expected from a layered earth model, (2) the arrival is at a nearly constant time‐depth on all data, and (3) the arrival tends to be followed by a ringing coda whose frequency varies from trace to trace. This arrival ties exactly with a velocity discontinuity measured in a borehole located on one of the profiles that we interpret as the base of the weathered layer. We suggest this arrival is a specular reflection from a weathering front that occurs along horizontal sheeting joints at a fixed depth below the surface. This surface acts as an effective mirror for high‐frequency seismic waves which are then channeled upward through an intact, high-Q path of unaltered blocks of granodiorite to define the observed signals at the surface.",10.1190/1.1444688
Prestack Kirchhoff Depth Migration Of Shallow Seismic Data,"Prestack Kirchhoff depth migration is applied successfully to shallow seismic data from a waste disposal site near Arnstadt in Thuringia, Germany. The motivation behind this study was to locate an underground building buried in a waste disposal. The processing sequence of the prestack migration is simplified significantly as compared to standard common (CMP) data processing. It includes only two parts: (1) velocity‐depth‐model estimation and (2) prestack depth migration. In contrast to conventional CMP stacking, prestack migration does not require a separation of reflections and refractions in the shot data. It still provides an appropriate image. Our data example shows that a superior image can be achieved that would contain not just subtle improvements but a qualitative step forward in resolution and signal‐to‐noise ratio.",10.1190/1.1444425
Direct Design Of Two‐Dimensional Digital Wavenumber Filters,"A closed form solution is derived for generating the space domain weighting coefficients for phase‐distortionless low‐pass filters with flat pass regions, variable cutoff wavenumbers (kc) and variable cutoff rates (Δk). High‐pass and bandpass filters can be designed using the same basic algorithm. The error in the spectrum of the filters, due to truncation of the weighting coefficient set, depends on both Δk and kc. An empirical error analysis yielded criteria for estimating the size of the coefficient array for an acceptable error level in the spectrum.",10.1190/1.1440143
The Migrator'S Equation For Anisotropic Media,"The migrator's equation, which gives the relationship between real and apparent dips on a reflector in zero‐offset reflection seismic sections, may be readily implemented in one step with a frequency‐domain migration algorithm for homogeneous media. Huygens' principle is used to derive a similar relationship for anisotropic media where velocities are directionally dependent. The anisotropic form of the migrator's equation is applicable to both elliptically and nonelliptically anisotropic media. Transversely isotropic media are used to demonstrate the performance of an f-k implementation of the migrator's equation for anisotropic media. In such a medium SH-waves are elliptically anisotropic, while P-waves are nonelliptically anisotropic. Numerical model data and physical model data demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, in each case recovering the original structure. Isotropic and anisotropic migration of anisotropic physical model data are compared experimentally, where the anisotropic velocity function of the medium has a vertical axis of symmetry. Only when anisotropic migration is used is the original structure recovered.",10.1190/1.1442789
Time-Varying Wavelet Estimation And Deconvolution By Kurtosis Maximization,"Phase mismatches sometimes occur between final processed sections and zero-phase synthetics based on well logs, despite best efforts for controlled-phase acquisition and processing. The latter are often based on deterministic corrections derived from field measurements and physical laws. A statistical analysis of the data can reveal whether a time-varying nonzero phase is present. This assumes that the data should be white with respect to all statistical orders after proper deterministic corrections have been applied. Kurtosis maximization by constant phase rotation is a statistical method that can reveal the phase of a seismic wavelet. It is robust enough to detect time-varying phase changes. Phase-only corrections can then be applied by means of a time-varying phase rotation. Alternatively, amplitude and phase deconvolution can be achieved using time-varying Wiener filtering. Time-varying wavelet extraction and deconvolution can also be used as a data-driven alternative to amplitude-only inverse- Q  deconvolution.",10.1190/1.2831936
Seismic Contouring: A Unique Skill,"Seismic contouring is a unique skill that requires combining the variable nature of the seismic signal with the varying structural styles of rock deformation. The computer is very helpful in producing suites of maps quickly, but it has often failed to incorporate structural styles and faults into meaningful geologic contours. This integration requires a visual image of the evolving structures that can best be obtained by an interpreter's hand contouring or with an interactive work station guided by an interpreter's hand. Each of the following situations requires a different approach to contouring and mapping the seismic data: (1) Three major styles of rock folding— (a) concentric folding, requiring smooth, hyperbolic contours: (b) plastic flow, requiring parallel contours and rounded reversals; and (c) topographic folding, requiring equal‐spaced contours and closed highs and lows. (2) Faults—May be difficult to visualize unless they are properly annotated and integrated into the contours. (3) Isotime maps—Should be contoured in the shape of depositional bodies. (4) Phantom horizon and dip maps—Needed when there are no continuous horizons. These maps can be useful as reconnaissance maps for planning programs in frontier areas. (5) Prospect (manager's) maps—The summation of all previous maps. They must be precise, clear, and simple. They must say, ""Here's the oil!""",10.1190/1.1442509
The Inverse Problem Of Resistivity Sounding,"The electric potential due to a single point electrode at the surface of a layered conducting medium is calculated by means of a linear combination of the potentials associated with a set of two‐layer systems. This new representation is called the bilayer expansion for the Green's function. It enables the forward problem of resistivity sounding to be solved very efficiently, even for complicated profiles. Also, the bilayer expansion facilitates the solution of the resistivity inverse problem: the coefficients in the expansion are linearly related to apparent resistivity as it is measured and they are readily mapped into parameters for a model. Specifically, I consider models comprising uniformly conducting layers of equal thickness; for a given finite data set a quadratic program can be used to find the best‐fitting model in this class for any specified thickness. As the thickness is reduced, models of this kind can approximate arbitrary profiles with unlimited accuracy. If there is a model that satisfies the data well, there are other models equally good or better whose variation takes place in an infinitesimally thin zone near the surface, below which there is a perfectly conducting region. This extraordinary class of solutions underscores the serious ambiguity in the interpretation of apparent resistivity data. It is evident that strong constraints from outside the electrical data set must be applied if reliable solutions are to be discovered. Previous work seems to have given a somewhat overly optimistic impression of the resolving abilities of this kind of data. I consider briefly a regularization technique designed to maximize the smoothness of models found with the bilayer inversion.",10.1190/1.1441630
Resistivity Signal Partition In Layered Media,"Using a method given by Roy and Apparao (1971), the separate contributions to the measured resistivity sounding curve by the individual layers have been precisely determined for two‐layer and three‐layer (ρ1-ρ2-ρ1) models. The substratum in the former, and the middle ρ2-layer in the latter, constitute the targets in the two models. For the two‐layer model, a resistive substratum causes a positive anomaly by contributing higher than normal to the signal measured on the ground surface, while a conducting substratum gives rise to a ""negative"" anomaly (resistivity low) by contributing less than its normal share. As the two‐layer anomaly develops fully only at infinitely large spacings, it follows that an infinitely resistive basement contributes infinitely although no current flows through it, while a perfectly conducting basement contributes nothing even though it carries the entire current flow. For the three‐layer model, the anomaly peak or trough (as the case may be) is formed at intermediate spacings and is contributed to both by the target and the region external to it. Both these regions contribute more than normal for resistive targets and less than normal for conductive targets. At the anomaly peak for high positive values of k=(ρ2-ρ1)/(ρ2+ρ1), the contribution from the target dominates and accounts for the bulk of the resistivity high. At the anomaly trough observed for large negative values of k, on the other hand, the fall in contribution from the extra‐target region becomes the main cause for the resistivity low. At each spacing and k, the sum of the contributions from the individual layers, of course, is exactly equal to the observed or measured value.",10.1190/1.1440421
Magnetic Field Analysis Of Morro Do Leme Nickel Deposit,"The Morro do Leme laterite nickel deposit lies inside the western border of the Parecis Basin (Brazil). This deposit is characterized by high concentrations of lateritic Ni (about 1.8%) and anomalous contents of Pd, Au, Cu, Na, Co, Zn, and Pt in a peridotite and dunite layered intrusion. Besides the existence of geochemical and drilling data, the 3D distribution in the subsurface of this layered intrusion is still unknown. An airborne magnetic survey revealed three east–west elongated magnetic anomalies, characterized by a significant remanent magnetization. The sources of these anomalies were delimitated laterally and had their depths estimated between 90 and 150 m, using techniques that use derivatives. Further, the total magnetization direction was obtained from a distortion analysis of the magnetic anomalies. All these data were united in an initial model for the 3D inversion of the magnetic data. The total and induced magnetization directions were attributed to the inverted model of 0.12 (SI) susceptibility, allowing indirect estimation of the remanence. The model, defined by the depth, the inversion, and the remanence estimates, linked the intrusion to analogue events in the Rondonian-San Ignácio Province. The results indicated that to explore for laterite Ni, the best locations are the southern part of the main anomaly and in the cover above the two smaller anomalies, whereas to explore for Pd, Au, Cu, Na, Co, Zn, and/or Pt, the indicated region is the central portion of the main anomaly.",10.1190/geo2014-0131.1
Equivalent Electrical Networks Of Some Seismographs,"The magnetic and electrostatic geophones are represented by means of ""equivalent electrical circuits"" which consist of linear networks, the characteristics of which are such as to give an external behaviour identical to that of a geophone. Various types of seismographs are considered from the standpoint of equivalent electrical networks and a few typical cases are treated quantitatively.",10.1190/1.1438086
On The Nonuniqueness Of Traveltime Inversion In Elliptically Anisotropic Media,"Elliptical velocity dependence on the direction of wave propagation is the simplest type of anisotropy that might be encountered in the subsurface. When the symmetry axis is vertical, describing elliptical anisotropy (EA) requires only one parameter — the ellipticity coefficient — in addition to the conventional isotropic velocity. It is tempting, therefore, to use elliptical anisotropy as a testing ground for various anisotropic parameter-estimation techniques. This apparently straightforward thinking, however, fails to deliver satisfactory results because traveltime inversion in certain EA media is known to be nonunique. Here, I prove this nonuniqueness to be a general property of all EA media and explicitly show that a constant depth stretch generates a family of kinematically equivalent EA models for any given spatial distribution of the ellipticity coefficient and the velocity.",10.1190/1.3151798
Single Water Gun Far‐Field Pressure Signatures Estimated From Near‐Field Measurements,"An important recent development in marine seismic data acquisition is the introduction of the Gemini technique (Newman, 1983, Haskey et al., 1983). The technique involves the use of a single Sodera water gun as a reference source together with the conventional air gun or water gun array which is fired a second or two after firing the reference source. The near‐field pressure signature radiated by the reference source is monitored continuously. The main advantage of the Gemini technique is that a shallow high;resolution section is recorded simultaneously with that obtained from the main array.",10.1190/1.1441916
Depth Prediction From Velocity Profiles On The Texas Gulf Coast,"Velocity profile accuracy in depth prediction in a Texas Gulf Coast area has been statistically estimated by two methods: 1) a comparison of profiles to well surveys; 2) a study of errors in marker horizon depth estimates made in wildcats prior to drilling and in wells that had already been drilled. Both methods point to an accuracy of 1 to 2 percent in 80 percent of the samples at depths ranging from 5000 ft to 12,000 ft. Accuracy fails off fairly rapidly below 12,000 ft, but 50 percent of the samples still exhibit an accuracy of 2 percent or better at 15,000 ft. This accuracy is attributed to the two‐mile spread lengths used, the overall good quality and density of the data, and to the moderate velocity range, 7000 ft/sec to 11,000 ft/sec.",10.1190/1.1440534
A Simple Approach To Improve The S/N Ratio For Tem Data Using Multiple Receivers,"Since electromagnetic (EM) techniques are very sensitive to cultural noise, many cases exist where standard processing techniques do not yield satisfactory signal‐to‐noise ratios (S/N). For EM surveys in areas with coherent regional EM noise we have developed a local noise compensation (LNC) technique. This technique, for transient EM methods, uses several mobile receivers referenced to a nearby (local) base station. LNC is applied as a prestack processing technique, and it is intended for multichannel systems with close receiver spacings. The main premise for LNC is that the regional noise is highly correlated over a region around the base station and that any other, more localized, noise is small. These assumptions must be tested at the beginning of the survey. The base station remains fixed with measurements being recorded continuously. Meanwhile, measurements are made at various other mobile stations in the zone of coherent noise. During the subsequent signal processing and removal of the transient signal, the actual noise at the base station is calculated as a function of time. Then, this noise is subtracted from the time series measured at the mobile sites. The method results in improvements in data quality, in depth of investigation and in productivity. Field tests carried out in Germany demonstrate results in an environment where the initial test showed that the necessary assumptions were not satisfied, although improvements in the S/N of the single records were obtained. Field tests in the Peoples Republic of China show a successful application of the technique, whereby the length of the usable signal was increased by a factor of about ten.",10.1190/1.1443104
Seismic Migration Of Blended Shot Records With Surface-Related Multiple Scattering,"This paper focuses on the concept of using blended data and multiple scattering directly in the migration process, meaning that the blended input data for the proposed migration algorithm includes blended surface-related multiples. It also means that both primary and multiple scattering contribute to the seismic image of the subsurface. Essential in our approach is that multiples are not included in the Green's functions but are part of the incident wavefields, utilizing the so-called double illumination property. We find that complex incident wavefields, such as blended primaries and/or blended multiples, require a reformulation of the imaging principle in order to provide broadband angle-dependent reflection properties.",10.1190/1.3521658
Semblance And Other Coherency Measures For Multichannel Data,"The concept of semblance is introduced, along with a descriptive review of several of the more common likeness or coherence measures. Measures are considered from three points of view: the domain in which they are applied, the philosophy of their design, and the manner in which they are used. Crosscorrelation, the most familiar of the likeness criteria, is examined in detail. Differences of design philosophy are noted as expressing themselves by a change in the normalization. Semblance is shown to be related to an energy‐normalized crosscorrelation and to share certain features of the summation method or stack which has been used recently as a coherence measure. Several coherence measures, including semblance, are considered in a problem environment—the determination of stacking velocities from multiple ground coverage seismic data. A noise‐free synthetic example is studied in order to compare discrimination thresholds of the various methods. Semblance, when properly interpreted, proves to have the greatest power of discrimination among the candidates examined for the particular application.",10.1190/1.1440186
Application Of Filter Theory And Information Theory To The Interpretation Of Gravity Measurements,"A wavenumber filter can be used in conjunction with the Hartley‐Tuller‐Shannon formula to bring about some reduction in the number of ambiguous contours on a gravity map. The filter focuses the interpreter's attention on the maximum response to density changes within a given layer. At the same time, characteristics of the filter design, such as bandwidth and power of the desired output relative to other interfering outputs, can be used in the H‐T‐S formula to determine a minimum contouring threshold, such that the relative number of false anomalies and missed true anomalies is minimized. In addition, it is also possible to estimate a lower limit on the probability that an anomaly observed on a map originates in a target layer.",10.1190/1.1439794
Interferometry By Deconvolution: Part 1 — Theory For Acoustic Waves And Numerical Examples,"Interferometry allows for synthesis of data recorded at any two receivers into waves that propagate between these receivers as if one of them behaves as a source. This is accomplished typically by crosscorrelations. Based on perturbation theory and representation theorems, we show that interferometry also can be done by deconvolutions for arbitrary media and multidimensional experiments. This is important for interferometry applications in which (1) excitation is a complicated source-time function and/or (2) when wavefield separation methods are used along with interferometry to retrieve specific arrivals. Unlike using crosscorrelations, this method yields only causal scattered waves that propagate between the receivers. We offer a physical interpretation of deconvolution interferometry based on scattering theory. Here we show that deconvolution interferometry in acoustic media imposes an extra boundary condition, which we refer to as the free-point or clamped-point boundary condition, depending on the measured field quantity. This boundary condition generates so-called free-point scattering interactions, which are described in detail. The extra boundary condition and its associated artifacts can be circumvented by separating the reference waves from scattered wavefields prior to interferometry. Three wavefield-separation methods that can be used in interferometry are direct-wave interferometry, dual-field interferometry, and shot-domain separation. Each has different objectives and requirements.",10.1190/1.2904554
3‐D Imaging Using Higher Order Fast Marching Traveltimes,"Recently, fast marching methods (FMM) beyond first order have been developed for producing rapid solutions to the eikonal equation. In this paper, we present imaging results for 3‐D prestack Kirchhoff migration using traveltimes computed using the first‐order and second‐order FMM on several 3‐D prestack synthetic and real data sets. The second order traveltimes produce a much better image of the structure. Moreover, insufficiently sampled first order traveltimes can introduce consistent errors in the common reflection point gathers that affect velocity analysis. First‐order traveltimes tend to be smaller than analytic traveltimes, which in turn affects the migration velocity analysis, falsely indicating that the interval velocity was too low.",10.1190/1.1468621
A Filtering Technique For Interpreting The Gravity Anomaly Generated By A Two‐Dimensional Fault,"In order to combine the advantages of a direct quantitative interpretation with an efficient regional‐residual separation, an interpretation technique based on characteristic curves derived through digital bandpass filtering has been developed for the two‐dimensional gravity fault model. Although the two‐dimensional fault model suffers from the lack of characteristic parameters, reasonably accurate direct interpretations are possible even in the presence of regional fields whose long wavelength spectral components overlap those of the anomaly. The characteristic curves given here were designed for use on relatively large deep structures with depths and thicknesses ranging from 0.8 to 8 km; however, the slight modifications necessary to accommodate any range are presented in detail.",10.1190/1.1440191
A Simplified Circuit Of The Seismic Electric Method And Its Steady‐State Solution,"The Seismic Electric Effect gives rise to the problem of finding the steady state response of a circuit consisting of an inductance and a response of a circuit consisting of an inductance and a resistance of the form R+A cos cot (RA) in series with a D.C. input. In this paper a solution is given, other than the one usually obtained by the method of successive approximations.",10.1190/1.1437121
Quantification Of Modeling Errors In Airborne Tem Caused By Inaccurate System Description,"Being able to recover accurate and quantitative descriptions of the subsurface electrical conductivity structure from airborne electromagnetic data is becoming more and more crucial in many applications such as hydrogeophysical and environmental mapping, but also for mining exploration. The effect on the inverted models of inaccurate system description in the 1D forward modeling of helicopter time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) data was studied. The most important system parameters needed for accurate description of the subsurface conductivity were quantified using a nominal airborne TEM system and three different reference models to ensure the generality of the conclusions. By calculating forward responses, the effect of changing the system transfer function of the nominal airborne TEM system was studied in detail. The data were inverted and the consequences of inaccurate modeling of the system transfer function were studied inthe model space. Errors in the description of the transfer function influence the inverted model differently. The low-pass filters, current turn-off, and receiver-transmitter (Rx-Tx) timing issues primarily influenced the early time gates. The waveform repetition, gate integration, altitude, and geometry mainly influenced the late time gates. Depth of investigation is highly model dependent, but in general the early times hold information on the shallower parts of the model and the late times hold information on the deeper parts of the model. Amplitude, gain, and current variations affect the entire sounding and therefore the entire model. The results showed that all of these parameters should be measured and modeled accurately during inversion of airborne TEM data. If not, the output model can differ quite dramatically from the true model. Layer boundaries can be inaccurate by tens of meters, and layer resistivities by as much as an order of magnitude. In the worst cases, the measured data simply cannot be fitted within noise level.",10.1190/1.3511354
Dimensions And Units Of Electromagnetic Quantities: Author'S Reply,"In the course of theoretical work and experimentation in the field it was my experience that the use of the m.k.s. system of units resulted in a saving of labor and also helped to clarify some concepts. The purpose of preparing my paper was, as stated, to present a conversion table and to bring to the attention of others the advantages of the m.k.s. system. These considerations, and an enterprising program committee, constituted my only ""irresistible urge to publish something on the subject.""",10.1190/1.1486568
Maximum Gravity Effect Of Certain Solids Of Revolution,"This paper presents formulae for calculating the gravitational attraction, at points on their central vertical axes, of several solids of revolution. Such calculations are sometimes desirable to find the maximum anomalies which may be caused by geologic bodies which are assumed to have the approximate shape of a solid of revolution. A reasonable set of density differences must be used in such preliminary gravity calculations to find the limits of the anomalies to be expected. A table of formulae is presented.",10.1190/1.1438497
"Magnetic, Electrical, And Gpr Waterborne Surveys Of Moraine Deposits Beneath A Lake: A Case History From Turin, Italy","Bathymetry and bottom sediment types of inland water basins provide meaningful information to estimate water reserves and possible connections between surface and groundwater. Waterborne geophysical surveys can be used to obtain several independent physical parameters to study the sediments. We explored the possibilities of retrieving information on both shallow and deep geological structures beneath a morainic lake by means of waterborne nonseismic methods. In this respect, we discuss simultaneous magnetic, electrical, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) waterborne surveys on the Candia morainic lake in northerly Turin (Italy). We used waterborne GPR to obtain information on the bottom sediment and the bathymetry needed to constrain the magnetic and electrical inversions. We obtained a map of the total magnetic field (TMF) over the lake from which we computed a 2D constrained compact magnetic inversion for selected profiles, along with a laterally constrained inversion for one electrical profile. The magnetic survey detected some deep anomalous bodies within the subbottom moraine. The electrical profiles gave information on the more superficial layer of bottom sediments. We identify where the coarse morainic material outcrops from the bottom finer sediments from a correspondence between high GPR reflectivity, resistivity, and magnetic anomalies.",10.1190/geo2011-0053.1
An Electromagnetic Analog Method For Computing Gravity And Magnetic Effects Of Two‐Dimensional Bodies,"An analog method can provide quick and accurate computation of gravity and magnetic anomalies arising from bodies in the form of horizontal cylinders of any arbitrary cross section and polarization. It has been possible to simulate the gravitational and magnetic fields of such a body by a current system flowing along a set of parallel wires. The underlying principle is that the magnetic field due to current in a long straight wire is mathematically similar to the gravitational field due to a line mass of uniform density. This similarity has been extended to the magnetic case, since the currents in the opposite directions reproduce the fields due to positive and negative line poles. Comparison of the simulated field for some simple bodies has been made with theoretically computed values. Generally, these agreed within less than 3 percent error. In the case of the magnetic analog it has been possible to reproduce the field for any direction of polarization perpendicular to the strike. It is also possible to simulate the effects of density changes or changes in susceptibility contrast and in permanent magnetism. The method may be extended to the measurement of magnetic field components for any direction of strike of the body. Torsion balance quantities may be simulated as well as simple field quantities.",10.1190/1.1439893
Continuous Active-Source Seismic Monitoring Of C O2 Injection In A Brine Aquifer,"Continuous crosswell seismic monitoring of a small-scale   C O2    injection was accomplished with the development of a novel tubing-deployed piezoelectric borehole source. This piezotube source was deployed on the   C O2    injection tubing, near the top of the saline aquifer reservoir at   1657-m   depth, and allowed acquisition of crosswell recordings at   15-minute   intervals during the multiday injection. The change in traveltime recorded at various depths in a nearby observation well allowed hour-by-hour monitoring of the growing   C O2    plume via the induced seismic velocity change. Traveltime changes of   0.2 to 1.0 ms   (up to 8%) were observed, with no change seen at control sensors placed above the reservoir. The traveltime measurements indicate that the   C O2    plume reached the top of the reservoir sand before reaching the observation well, where regular fluid sampling was occuring during the injection, thus providing information about the in situ buoyancy of   C O2   .",10.1190/1.2754716
Inversion Of Controlled-Source Electromagnetic Reflection Responses,"Marine controlled-source electromagnetic reflection responses can be retrieved by interferometry. These reflection responses are free of effects related to the water layer and the air above it and do not suffer from uncertainties related to the source position and orientation. Interferometry is a data-driven process requiring proper sampling of the electromagnetic field as well as knowledge of the material parameters at the receiver level, i.e., the sediment just below the receivers. We have inverted synthetic data sets using the reflection responses or the original electromagnetic fields with the goal of extracting the conductivity model of the subsurface. For the inversion, a genetic algorithm and a nonlinear conjugate-gradient algorithm were used. Our results show that an inversion of the reflection responses produces worse estimates of the vertical conductivity but superior estimates of the horizontal conductivity (especially for the reservoir) with respect to the original electromagnetic fields.",10.1190/geo2015-0320.1
Modeling Seismic Waves In Transversely Isotropic Media,"Seismic waves in anisotropic media are more complex than in isotropic media. Here we derive the propagating matrices for seismic waves in 2-D transversely isotropic medium (TIM). With eigen‐decomposition, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are given in analytical forms, therefore, calculation of propagators are simple and accurate. For a 2-D model of layered media, we compute the seismic responses to an impulse in the f-k domain, and then do a 2-D inverse Fourier transformation. Clear qP and qSV waves can be recognized from the resultant sections.",10.1190/1.1443561
Three-Dimensional Distribution Of Igneous Rocks Near The Pebble Porphyry Cu-Au-Mo Deposit In Southwestern Alaska: Constraints From Regional-Scale Aeromagnetic Data,"Aeromagnetic data helped us to understand the 3D distribution of plutonic rocks near the Pebble porphyry copper deposit in southwestern Alaska, USA. Magnetic susceptibility measurements showed that rocks in the Pebble district are more magnetic than rocks of comparable compositions in the Pike Creek–Stuyahok Hills volcano-plutonic complex. The reduced-to-pole transformation of the aeromagnetic data demonstrated that the older rocks in the Pebble district produce strong magnetic anomaly highs. The tilt derivative transformation highlighted northeast-trending lineaments attributed to Tertiary volcanic rocks. Multiscale edge detection delineated near-surface magnetic sources that are mostly outward dipping and coalesce at depth in the Pebble district. The total horizontal gradient of the 10-km upward-continued magnetic data showed an oval, deep magnetic contact along which porphyry deposits occur. Forward and inverse magnetic modeling showed that the magnetic rocks in the Pebble district extend to depths greater than 9 km. Magnetic inversion was constrained by a near-surface, 3D geologic model that is attributed with measured magnetic susceptibilities from various rock types in the region. The inversion results indicated that several near-surface magnetic sources with moderate susceptibilities converge with depth into magnetic bodies with higher susceptibilities. This deep magnetic source appeared to rise toward the surface in several areas. An isosurface value of 0.02 SI was used to depict the magnetic contact between outcropping granodiorite and nonmagnetic sedimentary host rocks. The contact was shown to be outward dipping. At depths around 5 km, nearly the entire model exceeded the isosurface value indicating the limits of nonmagnetic host material. The inversion results showed the presence of a relatively deep, northeast-trending magnetic low that parallels lineaments mapped by the tilt derivative. This deep low represents a strand of the Lake Clark fault.",10.1190/geo2013-0326.1
An Inverse Method Of Magnetotelluric Analysis For A Multilayered Earth,"In the inverse method of analysis, the model for the resistivity structure is deduced from the data. An iterative process is developed wherein the maximum residual between the measured data and the theoretically deduced values for a successively increasing number of layers is reduced to a value less than the scatter in the data. In carrying out this procedure the parameters for each successive layer are determined and the number of layers required in the interpretation is determined by both the spectral range of the data and the scatter.",10.1190/1.1439999
Source Signature Determination From Ministreamer Data,"Two methods for estimating the pressure wavefield generated by a marine airp‐gun array are tested. Data have been acquired at a ministreamer located below the source array. Effective source signatures for each air gun are estimated. In the first method a nonlinear inversion algorithm is used, where the forward modeling scheme is based upon a physical modeling of the air bubble generated by each air gun. In the second method a linear inversion method is used, with the assumption that the physics in the problem can be described by the acoustic wave equation with explosive point sources as the driving term. From the estimated effective source signatures, far‐field signatures have been calculated for both methods and compared with measured far‐field signatures. The error energy between the measured and estimated far‐field signatures was approximately 8 percent for both methods.",10.1190/1.1443683
The Effect Of The Extent Of Freezing On Seismic Velocities In Unconsolidated Permafrost,"We develop a model to relate velocities of seismic waves in unconsolidated permafrost is idealized as an assemblage of spherical quartz grains imbedded in a matrix composed of spherical water inclusions in ice. The theory of Kuster and Toksöz, based on wave‐scattering considerations, is used to determine the effective elastic moduli, and hence the wave speeds. The Hasin-Shtrikman theoretical bounds on the elastic moduli of heterogeneous materials and considerations establish the plausibility of the model. The model predicts Vp and Vs to be decreasing functions of both the porosity and the water‐to‐ice ratio, and the ratio Vp/Vs to be an increasing function of these two parameters. The theory is then applied to laboratory measurements of shear‐ and compressional‐wave velocities in 23 permafrost samples from different sites in the Beaufort Sea, Mackenzie River Valley, and Canadian Arctic islands. Although no direct measurements were made of the extents of freezing in these samples, the data are consistent with the predictions of the model. We show the theory can be used to predict the extent of freezing of the water in the pore spaces, based on knowledge of the porosity and either of the two wave speeds.",10.1190/1.1442181
Higher Derivatives Analysis Of 2-D Magnetic Data,"This paper presents a new approach for determining the depth of a buried structure from numerical second‐, third‐, and fourth‐horizontal‐derivative anomalies obtained from 2-D magnetic data using filters of successive graticule spacings. The problem of depth determination has been transformed into the problem of finding a solution to a nonlinear equation of the form z = f(z). Formulas have been derived for a horizontal cylinder and a dike. The depths obtained from the second‐, third‐, and fourth‐derivative anomaly values can be used to determine simultaneously the actual depth to the buried structure and the optimum order of the regional magnetic field along the profile. This powerful technique can solve two major potential field problems: regional residual separation and depth determination. The method is applied to theoretical data with and without random errors and is tested on a field example from Arizona.",10.1190/1.1444896
"Ground-Penetrating Radar Profiles Of The Mcmurdo Shear Zone, Antarctica, Acquired With An Unmanned Rover: Interpretation Of Crevasses, Fractures, And Folds Within Firn And Marine Ice","The crevassed firn of the McMurdo shear zone (SZ) within the Ross Ice Shelf may also contain crevasses deep within its meteoric and marine ice, but the surface crevassing prevents ordinary vehicle access to investigate its structure geophysically. We used a lightweight robotic vehicle to tow 200- and 400-MHz ground-penetrating radar antennas simultaneously along 100 parallel transects over a 28  km2 grid spanning the SZ width. Transects were generally orthogonal to the ice flow. Total firn and meteoric ice thickness was approximately 160 m. Firn crevasses profiled at 400 MHz were up to 16 m wide, under snow bridges up to 10 m thick, and with strikes near 35°–40° to the transect direction. From the top down, 200-MHz profiles revealed firn diffractions originating to a depth of approximately 40 m, no discernible structure within the meteoric ice, a discontinuous transitional horizon, and at least 20 m of stratified marine ice; 28–31 m of freeboard found more marine ice exists. Based on 10 consecutive transects covering approximately 2.5  km2, we preliminarily interpreted the transitional horizon to be a thin saline layer, and marine ice hyperbolic diffractions and reflections to be responses to localized fractures, and crevasses filled with unstratified marine ice, all at strikes from 27° to 50°. We preliminarily interpreted off-nadir, marine ice horizons to be responses to linear and folded faults, similar to some in firn. The coinciding and synchronously folded areas of fractured firn and marine ice suggested that the visibly unstructured meteoric ice beneath our grid was also fractured, but either never crevassed, crevassed and sutured without marine ice inclusions, or that any ice containing crevasses might have eroded before marine ice accretion. We will test these interpretations with analysis of all transects and by extending our grid and increasing our depth ranges.",10.1190/geo2015-0132.1
A Boundary Element Method For 2-D Dc Resistivity Modeling With A Point Current Source,"A new boundary element method (BEM) is presented for 2-D dc resistivity modeling with a point source. When compared with previously published techniques, the new method has two main features: (1) The normal derivative of potential has been eliminated from the integral equation. The formulation of the present method is simpler and requires less memory and time than the previous published methods. (2) Multiple subsurface inhomogeneous bodies can be modeled. For a simple testing model, the maximum relative error of reciprocity test is 0.24% and the average relative error is 0.05%. For the same model, the maximum relative difference between the BEM solution and the finite‐element method solution is 1.14% and the average relative difference is 0.73%. For a field geoelectrical profile, the responses of the constructed model agree with the observed data quite well.",10.1190/1.1444339
Electrical Prospecting With Non‐Sinusoidal Alternating Currents,A method of electrical prospecting using alternating current of rectangular or other non‐sinusoidal waveform is described. The changes in waveform caused by anomalous subsurface structure are determined by a null method in which the detected electromotive force is balanced against an electromotive force produced by passing the output of a standard oscillator through an adjustable network. This process of measurement (applicable also to the transient method) makes possible a useful representation of the data in terms of two‐dimensional contours.,10.1190/1.1439510
The Specification And Testing Of A Seismic‐Refraction System For Crustal Studies,"A new seismic‐refraction system built for the U. S. Geological Survey for crustal studies has been tested in the laboratory and shown to meet strict performance specifications for broad frequency response, low noise, high gain, and high dynamic range. The inherent advantages of magnetic recording, with selective filtering on playback, were demonstrated in field tests by the recovery of weak events that otherwise would be obscured by high seismic noise.",10.1190/1.1438963
Formulas And Curves For The Interpretation Of Certain Two‐Dimensional Magnetic And Gravitational Anomalies,"Curves and formulas for the interpretation of the two‐dimensional ""dike"" and ""step"" are given because they offer an easy, rapid method of solving all cases to which they apply. Horizontal and vertical polarization of the bodies are considered. This method applies to torsion balance surveys, and to magnetic surveys where the horizontal and vertical components of the earth's magnetic field are measured. Two curves for the interpretation of an anomaly in terms of a point pole (or a point mass) are given. The depth to the two‐dimensional structures is considered, with formulas and curves.",10.1190/1.1441812
Terrain Corrections For Gravimeter Stations,"In this paper the correction for the gravitational attraction of the topography on a gravity station is considered as consisting of two parts; (1) the restricted but conventional ""Bouguer correction"" which postulates as a convenient approximation that the topography consists of an infinite horizontal plain, and (2) the ""Terrain correction"" which is a supplementary correction taking into account the gravitational effect of the undulations of the terrain about the plane through the gravity station. The paper illustrates the necessity of making terrain corrections if precise gravity surveys are desired in hilly country and presents terrain correction tables with which this quantity may be determined to a relative accuracy of one‐tenth milligal. This accuracy is required to fully utilize the high instrumental precision of modern gravimeters.",10.1190/1.1440495
Seismic Model Experiments With Shear Waves,"The experimental study of shear waves in the earth has been limited by the difficulty of producing them in sufficient strength. However, sensitive piezoelectric shear plates can now be made which enable experimentation with shear waves using small‐scale seismic models. Seismic model experiments serve to demonstrate the simplicity of SH‐shear wave reflections in a single homogeneous layer, the production of SH waves by an impulsive horizontal thrust, and the development of relatively high amplitude Love waves in a low‐velocity surface layer. The results of these model experiments with shear waves are in general agreement with and confirm theory. They also agree with the results of field experiments in the scattered cases for which comparison is available.",10.1190/1.1438564
Seismoelectric Interface Response: Experimental Results And Forward Model,"Understanding the seismoelectric interface response is important for developing seismoelectric field methods for oil exploration and environmental/engineering geophysics. The existing seismoelectric theory has never been validated systematically by controlled experiments. We have designed and developed an experimental setup in which acoustic-to- electromagnetic wave conversions at interfaces are measured. An acoustic source emits a pressure wave that impinges upon a porous sample. The reflected electric-wave potential is recorded by a wire electrode. We have also developed a full-waveform electrokinetic theoretical model based on the Sommerfeld approach and have compared it with measurements at positions perpendicular and parallel to the fluid/porous-medium interface. We performed experiments at several salinities. For 10-3 and 10-2 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions, both waveforms and amplitudes agree. For 10-4 M NaCl, however, amplitude deviations occur. We found that a single amplitude field scaling factor describes these discrepancies. We also checked the repeatability of experiments. The amplitudes are constant for the duration of an experiment (1–4 hours) but decrease on longer time scales     ( ~ 24   hours ) . However, the waveforms and spatial amplitude pattern of the electric wavefield are preserved over time. Our results validate electrokinetic theory for the seismic-to-electromagnetic-wave conversion at interfaces for subsurface exploration purposes.",10.1190/1.3592984
Linearization Of The P‐Wave Eikonal Equation For Weak Vertical Transverse Isotropy,"I develop approximate P‐wave and SV‐wave eikonal equations for weak vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) media and then use perturbation theory to solve the P‐wave eikonal equation. I proceed by expressing the exact VTI eikonal equations for P‐waves and SV‐waves in terms of the intuitive ""Thomsen"" anisotropy parameters and then linearizing the results with respect to these parameters. Next, I apply perturbation theory (with a heterogeneous, isotropic ""reference"" medium) to the P‐wave weak VTI eikonal equation. This results in a linear partial differential equation for the traveltime perturbation, which I solve analytically along raypaths in the isotropic reference medium. Traveltimes in the weak VTI medium may then be obtained by simply integrating the reference slowness function plus the (weighted) anisotropy perturbations along raypaths in the isotropic reference medium. This simple solution may be incorporated into standard isotropic ray tracing or traveltime generation methods to produce traveltimes for weak VTI media. I analytically incorporated the method into an isotropic eikonal equation solver and tested it on a vertically heterogeneous weak VTI model, where the strength of the anisotropy was 5–15%. Comparison against results from an exact VTI ray tracing code showed that, for lateral distances up to twice the depth, the weak VTI traveltimes and phase angles were accurate to within 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively. This linear theory yields a physical understanding for how the anisotropy parameters cause traveltimes in VTI media to differ from those in isotropic media. Applications of the theory also include traveltime computation and insights into linear tomographic velocity estimation of reflection seismic data in weak VTI media.",10.1190/1.1581079
Application Of Image Segmentation To Tracking 3D Salt Boundaries,"Delineating salt boundaries is a necessary step in the velocity-model building process. The salt-delineation problem can be thought of as an image-segmentation problem. Normalized cuts image segmentation (NCIS) finds the cut (or cuts) that result in an image being broken into portions which have dissimilar, by some measure, characteristics. We apply a modified version of the NCIS method to partition seismic images along salt boundaries. NCIS can track boundaries that are not continuous, where conventional horizon-tracking algorithms may fail, by calculating a weight connecting each pixel in the image to every other pixel within a local neighborhood. The weights are determined using problem-dependent combinations of attributes, the most important being instantanteous amplitude and dip. The weights for the entire image are used to segment the image via an eigenvector calculation. The weight matrices for 3D seismic data cubes can be quite large and computationally expensive. By imposing bounds and by distributing the algorithm on a parallel cluster, we significantly increase efficiency. This method is demonstrated to be effective on a 3D field seismic data cube.",10.1190/1.2732553
The Geophysical Discovery And Development Of The Bayou Couba Dome,"This case history of the Bayou Couba Dome, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, reports the results of seismic refraction, seismic reflection, and gravity exploration leading to the discovery of the dome. These data, together with the results of additional exploration done to define the dome, compare favorably with the actual dome shape to the extent it is determined by drilling.",10.1190/1.1437885
A Feasibility Study Of Co2 Sequestration Monitoring Using The Mcsem Method At A Deep Brine Aquifer In A Shallow Sea,"Reservoir production monitoring using marine controlled-source electromagnetic (mCSEM) has been studied recently because it is sensitive to resistivity changes resulting from variations in hydrocarbon saturation. However, mCSEM for CO2 sequestration monitoring has scarcely been investigated, although the mCSEM method is advantageous for monitoring CO2 injection and migration. To investigate the feasibility of mCSEM monitoring for CO2 sequestration, we conducted numerical experiments of representative CO2 injection models at a deep brine aquifer in a shallow sea. By using a modified secondary field method, we effectively address the airwave problem occurring when mCSEM is applied to a target beneath a shallow sea. We demonstrate the modified secondary field method can restore high frequency band data, which is beneficial for the detection of the movement of injected CO2. Furthermore, using a modified scattered field approach for 2.5D forward modeling, we achieve very high accuracy, which is essential for the simulation of electromagnetic fields generated by CO2 injection in a deep brine aquifer. The mCSEM response, which is enhanced by the modified secondary field method, shows small but measurable changes in a given pseudorealistic CO2 sequestration scenario. The mCSEM responses differ for horizontal and vertical injections. These results include the feasibility of applying mCSEM to CO2 sequestration monitoring. Optimum operating frequency bands and source-receiver geometries for a brine aquifer model beneath a shallow sea are proposed based on the results of the numerical experiments. Moreover, we suggest the necessity of various types of data acquisition for the monitoring of a CO2 plume based on analyses of multiple components of electric and magnetic fields.",10.1190/geo2011-0089.1
Waveform Inversion Using A Back-Propagation Algorithm And A Huber Function Norm,"Waveform inversion faces difficulties when applied to real seismic data, including the existence of many kinds of noise. The  l1 -norm is more robust to noise with outliers than the least-squares method. Nevertheless, the least-squares method is preferred as an objective function in many algorithms because the gradient of the  l1 -norm has a singularity when the residual becomes zero. We propose a complex-valued Huber function for frequency-domain waveform inversion that combines the  l2 -norm (for small residuals) with the  l1 -norm (for large residuals). We also derive a discretized formula for the gradient of the Huber function. Through numerical tests on simple synthetic models and Marmousi data, we find the Huber function is more robust to outliers and coherent noise. We apply our waveform-inversion algorithm to field data taken from the continental shelf under the East Sea in Korea. In this setting, we obtain a velocity model whose synthetic shot profiles are similar to the real seismic data.",10.1190/1.3112572
Mapping Groundwater Contamination Using Dc Resistivity And Vlf Geophysical Methods–A Case Study,"Geophysical methods can be helpful in mapping areas of contaminated soil and groundwater. Electrical resistivity and very low‐frequency electromagnetic induction (VLF) surveys were carried out at a site of shallow hydrocarbon contamination in Utah County, Utah. Previously installed monitoring wells facilitated analysis of water chemistry to enhance interpretation of the geophysical data. The electrical resistivity and VLF data correlate well, and vertical cross‐sections and contour maps generated from these data helped map the contaminant plume, which was delineated as an area of high interpreted resistivities.",10.1190/1.1444148
Potential Distribution Due To A Cylindrical Electrode Mounted On An Insulating Probe,"The potentials around a finite cylindrical electrode can be obtained by dividing the electrodes into rings of equal thickness and substituting an infinitely thin current ring for each of the slices. The field of an infinitely thin ring electrode mounted on an insulating cylindrical probe of the same diameter can be found by combining the properties of the delta function with a solution of Laplace's equation in cylindrical co‐ordinates. Combination of solutions for the infinitely thin rings under the condition that the potential of the electrode surface be constant leads to a system of simultaneous linear equations. By increasing the number of slices, the potential around the finite electrode can be found arbitrarily close. The problem of a cylindrical electrode on a sonde located coaxially in a conducting hole, drilled through a medium of different conductivity, is treated by the same method. This arrangement is of interest in electrical logging of drill holes. Numerical examples have been calculated on an IBM 650 magnetic drum computer. The potential along the surface of the insulating probe, at distances larger than twice the electrode length, can be approximated with good accuracy by assuming that all of the current is emitted from an infinitely thin ring located in the median plane of the electrode.",10.1190/1.1438627
The Role Of Attenuation In 2D Full-Waveform Inversion Of Shallow-Seismic Body And Rayleigh Waves,"Full-waveform inversion (FWI) of Rayleigh waves is attractive for shallow geotechnical investigations due to the high sensitivity of Rayleigh waves to the S-wave velocity structure of the subsurface. In shallow-seismic field data, the effects of anelastic damping are significant. Dissipation results in a low-pass effect as well as frequency-dependent decay with offset. We found this by comparing recorded waveforms with elastic and viscoelastic wave simulation. The effects of anelastic damping must be considered in FWI of shallow-seismic Rayleigh waves. FWI using elastic simulation of wave propagation failed in synthetic inversion tests in which we tried to reconstruct the S-wave velocity in a viscoelastic model. To overcome this, Q-values can be estimated from the recordings to quantify viscoelasticity. Waveform simulation in the FWI then uses these a priori values when inferring seismic velocities and density. A source-wavelet correction, which is inevitable in FWI of field data, can compensate a significant fraction of the residuals between elastically and viscoelastically simulated data by narrowing the signals' bandwidth. This way, elastic simulation becomes applicable in FWI of data from anelastic media. This approach, however, was not able to produce a frequency-dependent amplitude decay with offset. Reconstruction, therefore, was more accurate when using appropriate viscoelastic modeling in FWI of shallow-seismic Rayleigh waves. We found this by synthetic inversion tests using elastic forward simulation as well as viscoelastic simulation with different a priori values for Q.",10.1190/geo2013-0462.1
Three‐Dimensional Time‐Slice Migration,"Three‐dimensional migration of zero‐offset data using a velocity varying with depth can be performed in one pass using Fourier transforms of time slices. The migration process is carried out entirely in the two‐dimensional spatial Fourier domain. The algorithm consecutively filters and adds time slices of the 3-D data volume in a way that is equivalent to summing energy over the diffraction surface of a point scatterer. The partial energy being distributed along a circle in a time slice is properly added in each summation step. Time‐slice migration is based on an integral solution of the acoustic wave equation known as the ""Kirchhoff integral."" The wavelet shape in a 3-D data volume is preserved throughout the entire migration process. The frequency characteristics are maintained by summing weighted differences between time slices instead of summing the time slices themselves. Automatic weighting is achieved by time slicing at equal increments of diffraction radius. Tapering the summation operator reduces effects introduced by limiting the summation window. Time‐slice migration preserves the frequency content of a 3-D data volume during summation in a natural way. Since the migration scheme assumes a constant velocity within the entire time slice, it is a local process in time which migrates a 3-D data volume with a constant velocity or with a velocity which varies with depth. The migration algorithm is applied to numerical and physical model data. This method is especially suitable for a migration of a targeted subset of the 3-D data volume.",10.1190/1.1442764
The Effect Of Kerogen On The Elastic Anisotropy Of Organic-Rich Shales,"The elastic properties of reservoir rocks are important for geomechanics applications; the most important of which are: analysis of stress changes due to production, analysis of rock deformation and failure, wellbore trajectory optimization, and the design of hydraulic fractures. Organic-rich shales are often observed to be strongly anisotropic due to the partial alignment of anisotropic clay minerals and the bedding-parallel lamination of organic material within the shale. Neglecting shale anisotropy may lead to incorrect estimates of the in situ stress or stress changes resulting from production. As a result, isotropic models may fail to describe geomechanical behavior correctly. The distribution of the organic phase plays an important role in determining the elastic properties of organic-rich shales, and this has a significant effect on production-induced stress changes. The presence of kerogen leads to a decrease in all of the elastic moduli, and has a significant effect on the geomechanical behavior of shales. The change in horizontal effective stress for a given change in pore pressure resulting from production is greater for kerogen-rich shales, and the neglect of anisotropy in predicting such stress changes may lead to significant errors.",10.1190/geo2012-0309.1
Perturbation Approach To Depth Extrapolation,"The Born-series solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation does not necessarily converge properly for depth-extrapolation problems. Even more seriously, the Lippmann-Schwinger equation is not necessarily self-consistent for depth extrapolation, unless it is interpreted correctly. A solution is proposed by using the generalized Lippmann-Schwinger equation that includes boundary value contributions that normally are ignored. A modified version of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for depth extrapolation is obtained. The corrections to the Born-series expansion for depth extrapolation are demonstrated. The new system has the desired convergence and self-consistency properties. Explicit depth extrapolation is discussed in the context of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. A partial explanation for why explicit depth extrapolation works reasonably well in laterally inhomogeneous media may be that the contribution from the perturbation term in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for that problem is small for a wide variety of velocity models.",10.1190/1.1852786
Moveout Inversion Of P-Wave Data For Horizontal Transverse Isotropy,"The transversely isotropic model with a horizontal symmetry axis (HTI media) has been extensively used in seismological studies of fractured reservoirs. In this paper, a parameter‐estimation technique originally developed by Grechka and Tsvankin for the more general orthorhombic media is applied to horizontal transverse isotropy. Our methodology is based on the inversion of azimuthally‐dependent P-wave normal‐moveout (NMO) velocities from horizontal and dipping reflectors. If the NMO velocity of a given reflection event is plotted in each azimuthal direction, it forms an ellipse determined by three combinations of medium parameters. The NMO ellipse from a horizontal reflector in HTI media can be inverted for the azimuth β of the symmetry axis, the vertical velocity VP0, and the Thomsen‐type anisotropic parameter δ(V). We describe a technique for obtaining the remaining (for P-waves) anisotropic parameter η(V) (or ε(V)) from the NMO ellipse corresponding to a dipping reflector of arbitrary azimuth. The interval parameters of vertically inhomogeneous HTI media are recovered using the generalized Dix equation that operates with NMO ellipses for horizontal and dipping events. High accuracy of our method is confirmed by inverting a synthetic multiazimuth P-wave data set generated by ray tracing for a layered HTI medium with depth‐varying orientation of the symmetry axis. Although estimation of η(V) can be carried out by the algorithm developed for orthorhombic media, for more stable results the HTI model has to be used from the outset of the inversion procedure. It should be emphasized that P-wave conventional‐spread moveout data provide enough information to distinguish between HTI and lower‐symmetry models. We show that if the medium has the orthorhombic symmetry and is sufficiently different from HTI, the best‐fit HTI model cannot match the NMO ellipses for both a horizontal and a dipping event. The anisotropic coefficients responsible for P-wave moveout can be combined to estimate the crack density and predict whether the cracks are fluid‐filled or dry. A unique feature of the HTI model that distinguishes it from both vertical transverse isotropy and orthorhombic media is that moveout inversion provides not just zero‐dip NMO velocities and anisotropic coefficients, but also the true vertical velocity. As a result, reflection P-wave data acquired over HTI formations can be used to build velocity models in depth and perform anisotropic depth processing.",10.1190/1.1444628
Seismic Signal Detection Using Sign Bits,"By casting the problem of seismic signal detection as one of statistical detection theory, one can develop a myriad of detection statistics or detectors. Of these, one of the most promising appears to be sign‐bit semblance. This nonparametric detector makes use of only the sign bits of the seismic data and, hence, requires less storage and is faster to compute than other detection statistics. In addition, it is independent of the noise statistics, as are all nonparametric detectors. An automatic velocity analysis and interpretation program has been developed using sign‐bit semblance as the detection statistic. The statistical properties of sign‐bit semblance were such that this system could do a velocity analysis and an interpretation with no human intervention. In this mode of operation it yielded state‐of‐the‐art accuracy at greatly increased speed and with greatly reduced storage requirements. These results indicate that sign‐bit semblance can be used to advantage for certain other seismic‐data processing problems.",10.1190/1.1440394
An Examination Of Tube Wave Noise In Vertical Seismic Profiling Data,"Tube waves act as noise that camouflages upgoing and downgoing body wave events which are the fundamental seismic data measured in vertical seismic profiling (VSP). In two onshore vertical seismic profiles, the principal source of tube waves is shown to be surface ground roll that sweeps across the well head. Secondary tube wave sources revealed in these VSP data are the downhole geophone tool itself and the bottom of the borehole. Body wave signals are also shown to create tube waves when they arrive at significant impedance contrasts in the borehole such as changes in casing diameter. Computer simulated vertical geophone arrays are used to reduce these tube waves, but such arrays attenuate and filter body wave events unless static time shifts are made so that the body wave signal occurs at the same two‐way time at each geophone station. Consequently, actual downhole vertical geophone arrays are not an effective means by which tube waves can be eliminated. Power spectra comparisons of tube wave and compressional body wave events demonstrate that band‐pass filters designed to eliminate tube waves also suppress body wave signals. A simple but effective field technique for reducing tube waves is shown to be proper source offset. Using velocity filters to retrieve upgoing compressional events from VSP data heavily contaminated with tube wave noise yields in one example an agreement with surface measured reflections that is superior to that obtained from synthetic seismograms calculated from log data recorded in the same well.",10.1190/1.1441228
Challenges In Geophysical Mapping Of Glaciotectonic Structures,"Glaciotectonic complexes have been recognized worldwide — traditionally described on the basis of outcrops or geomorphological observations. In the past few decades, geophysics has become an integral part of geologic mapping, which enables the mapping of buried glaciotectonic complexes. The geophysical methods provide different types of information and degrees of resolution and thus, a different ability to resolve the glaciotectonic structures. We evaluated these abilities on the basis of an integrated application of four commonly used geophysical methods: airborne transient electromagnetics, high-resolution reflection seismic, geoelectrical, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). We covered an area of 100  km2 in a formerly glaciated region in the western part of Denmark. The geologic setting was highly heterogeneous with glaciotectonic deformation observed in the form of large-scale structures in the seismic and airborne transient electromagnetic data to small-scale structures seen in the GPR and geoelectrical data. The seismic and GPR data provided detailed structural information, whereas the geoelectrical and electromagnetic data provided indirect lithological information through resistivities. A combination of methods with a wide span in resolution capabilities can therefore be recommendable to characterize and understand the geologic setting. The sequence of application of the different methods is primarily determined by the gross expenditure required for acquisition and processing, e.g., per kilometer of the surveys. Our experience suggested that airborne electromagnetic data should be acquired initially to obtain a 3D impression of the geologic setting. Based on these data, areas can be selected for further investigation with the more detailed but also more expensive and time-consuming methods.",10.1190/geo2012-0473.1
A Microgal Approximation For The Bullard B—Earth'S Curvature—Gravity Correction,"An approximation of the Bullard B—earth's curvature—gravity correction is expressed in terms of fractions of the standard Bouguer slab terrain correction. The Bullard B correction is appropriate for either high‐resolution surveys or for rugged terrain such as the Rocky Mountains, where the correction can be as much as 1.5 mGal. The approximation has three terms, each separated from the others by roughly an order of magnitude, indicating a substantial segregation of physical effects. An analysis indicates that physically the three correction terms are for the curvature effect, the Bouguer slab truncation, and the thickness effect on curvature. The approximation is accurate to within 1 μGal for Bullard caps of less than 4-km thickness. The accuracy of the approximations is illustrated for the parameters of thickness and Bullard radius.",10.1190/1.1443009
Shallow Seismic Reflection Section—Introduction,"For those interested in shallow seismic reflection (SSR) techniques, this special issue of Geophysics is likely to serve as a useful reference for years to come. The idea for this issue grew out of discussions that took place at the Shallow Seismic Reflection Workshop at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, California, in September 1996. The content of those discussions is the subject of a published report elsewhere (Steeples et al., 1997). Several workshop participants and their colleagues contributed to the papers in this issue as authors and as reviewers. The articles include case histories, novel uses of the SSR technique, state‐of‐the‐art planning considerations for 3-D SSR surveys, and some examples of problems unique to SSR surveying.",10.1190/1.1444421
Investigations Of Andesitic Volcanic Debris Terrains: Part 2 — Geotechnical,"Here, results of geotechnical investigations for the proposed Dominica international airport are presented. The main geotechnical investigative method is comprised of boreholes to 30 m depth with standard penetrating testing (SPT) and undisturbed Shelby tube and disturbed split-spoon soil sampling. The geotechnical investigation confirms the findings of a companion geophysical investigation, which concludes that bedrock is not likely to be encountered within the proposed depths of excavation for the airport. Geophysical and geotechnical data correlations are developed. Seismic velocity and the number N of blow counts with SPT (SPT N) appear to be well correlated by a linear model. A model relationship between SPT and seismic dynamic elastic modulus is developed using seismic velocity. SPT N is better correlated with the dynamic elastic modulus than with seismic velocity. The study shows that the seismic velocity and the derived dynamic elastic moduli can accurately predict soil strength as measured by SPT blow counts.",10.1190/1.2159046
Quantifying The Effectiveness Of Stabilized Inverse Q Filtering,"Applying inverse Q filtering to surface seismic data may minimize the effect of dispersion and attenuation and hence improve the seismic resolution. In this case study, a stabilized inverse Q filter is applied to a land seismic data set, for which the prerequisite reliable earth Q function is estimated from the vertical seismic profile (VSP) downgoing wavefield. The paper focuses on the robust estimate of Q values from VSP data and on the quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the stabilized inverse Q filtering approach. The quantitative evaluation shows that inverse Q filtering may flatten the amplitude spectrum, strengthen the time‐variant amplitude, increase the spectral bandwidth, and improve the signal‐to‐noise (S/N) ratio. A parameter measuring the resolution enhancement is defined as a function of the changes in the bandwidth and the S/N ratio. The stabilized inverse Q filtering algorithm, which may provide a stable solution for compensating the high‐frequency wave components lost through attenuation, has positive changes in both the bandwidth and the S/N ratio, and thereby enhances the resolution of the final processed seismic data.",10.1190/1.1543219

Fresnel Volume Migration Of Single-Component Seismic Data,"Standard implementations of Kirchhoff prestack depth migration (PSDM) distribute the recorded wavefield along two-way-traveltime isochrons and an image is generated by constructive interference of these isochrons along the actual reflector elements. Beside the recent developments of wave-equation-based approaches, Kirchhoff PSDM is still considered widely as a state-of-the-art technique in obtaining high-quality images of the subsurface, particularly for highly irregular survey layouts and target-oriented imaging tasks. However, for sparse sampling or limited aperture, the resulting image is affected by significant migration noise as a result of limited constructive interference of the back-propagated wavefield. Some modifications have been proposed to reduce these artifacts. These modifications include constructing a specular path of wave propagation, derived from estimates of the emergent angle of coherent phases in the seismogram section, and the mainly heuristic restriction of the imaging operator to the neighborhood of that wavepath. Our approach uses Fresnel volumes to restrict the migration operator in a physically frequency-dependent way. Using the emergent angle at the receiver, determined by a local slowness analysis, a ray is propagated into the subsurface; the back-propagation of the wavefield is restricted to the vicinity of this ray according to its approximated Fresnel volume. This so-called Fresnel volume migration approach enhances image quality significantly compared with standard Kirchhoff PSDM because of the inherent focusing and the restriction of the back-propagation to the region around the actual reflection point.",10.1190/1.3223187
Relating Source-Receiver Interferometry To An Inverse-Scattering Series To Derive A New Method To Estimate Internal Multiples,"We have evaluated an explicit relationship between the representations of internal multiples by source-receiver interferometry and an inverse-scattering series. This provides a new insight into the interaction of different terms in each of these internal multiple prediction equations and explains why amplitudes of estimated multiples are typically incorrect. A downside of the existing representations is that their computational cost is extremely high, which can be a precluding factor especially in 3D applications. Using our insight from source-receiver interferometry, we have developed an alternative, computationally more efficient way to predict internal multiples. The new formula is based on crosscorrelation and convolution: two operations that are computationally cheap and routinely used in interferometric methods. We have compared the results of the standard and the alternative formulas qualitatively in terms of the constructed wavefields and quantitatively in terms of the computational cost using examples from a synthetic data set.",10.1190/geo2015-0330.1
Unipole Method Of Electrical Profiling,"In the unipole method of resistivity prospecting, an electrode arrangement AMNA′ with a third common electrode at infinity, is used as against the arrangement AMNB in the conventional bipole method. The electrodes A and A′ are connected to one and the same pole of electric current. In the case of the unipole method, field intensity at the center of the spread is zero for a homogeneous ground. This results in a pure‐anomaly method, increasing the depth of investigation and the sensitivity of field measurements considerably. The percentage of total current entering the deeper regions is larger in the unipole method than in the bipole method. The difference is further increased if a less resistive layer is present near the surface of the earth. Sensitivity of the unipole method to the near‐surface inhomogeneities is less than that of the bipole method. But the unipole method is more sensitive to the deeper inhomogeneities of interest. The unipole arrangement introduces some focusing of the current within a particular range of the depth which can be controlled by altering the spacing between the current electrodes. In general, response curves for the unipole method are less complicated and admit more controls for interpretation than those for the bipole method. A theoretical and experimental comparison of the unipole method with the conventional bipole method shows that the former method is more effective than the latter in certain applications. The field instruments used at present for the bipolar measurements can be very easily adapted to the unipole method.",10.1190/1.1439236
"True-Amplitude, Angle-Domain, Common-Image Gathers From One-Way Wave-Equation Migrations","True-amplitude wave-equation migration provides a quality migrated image of the earth's interior. In addition, the amplitude of the output provides an estimate of the angular-dependent reflection coefficient, similar to the output of Kirchhoff inversion. Recently, true-amplitude wave-equation migration for common-shot data has been proposed to generate amplitude-reliable, shot-domain, common-image gathers in heterogeneous media. We present a method to directly produce angle-domain common-image gathers from both common-shot and shot-receiver wave-equation migration. Generating true-amplitude, shot-domain, common-image gathers requires a deconvolution-type imaging condition using the ratio of the upgoing and downgoing wavefield, each downward-projected to the image point. Producing true-amplitude, angle-domain, common-image gathers requires, instead, the product of the upgoing wavefield and the complexconjugate of the downgoing wavefield in the imaging condition. Since multiplication is a more stable computational process than division, the new methods proposed provide more stable ways of inverting seismic data. Furthermore, the resulting common-image gathers can be directly used for migrated amplitude-variation-with angle analysis and tomography-based velocity analysis. Shot-receiver wave-equation migration requires new true-amplitude, one-way wave equations with one depth variable and transverse variables for the coordinates corresponding to sources and receivers, hence, two transverse coordinates in 2D and four transverse coordinates in 3D. We propose a modified double-square-root one-way wave equation to produce true amplitude common-image angle gathers. We also demonstrate the new methods with some synthetic examples. Some numerical examples show that the new methods we propose give better amplitude performance on the migrated angle gathers.",10.1190/1.2399371
Separation And Enhancement Of Split S‐Waves On Multicomponent Shot Records From The Birps Wispa Experiment,"Instantaneous rotations are combined with f-k filtering to extract coherent S‐wave events from multicomponent shot records recorded by British Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS) Weardale Integrated S‐wave and P‐wave analysis (WISPA) experiment. This experiment was an attempt to measure the Poisson's ratio of the lower crest by measuring P‐wave and S‐wave velocities. The multihole explosive source technique did generate S‐waves although not of opposite polarization. Attempts to produce stacks of the S‐wave data are unsuccessful because S‐wave splitting in the near surface produced random polarizations from receiver group to receiver group. The delay between the split wavelets varies but is commonly between 20 to 40 ms for 10 Hz wavelets. Dix hyperbola are produced on shot records after instantaneous rotations are followed by f-k filtering. To extract the instantaneous polarization, the traces are shifted back by the length of a moving window over which the calculation is performed. The instantaneous polarization direction is computed from the shifted data using the maximum eigenvector of the covariance matrix over the computation window. Split S‐waves are separated by the instantaneous rotation of the unshifted traces to the directions of the maximum eigenvectors determined for each position of the moving window. F-K filtering is required because of the presence of mode converted S‐waves and S‐waves produced by the explosive source near the time of detonation. Examples from synthetic data show that the method of instantaneous rotations will completely separate split S‐waves if the length of the moving window over which the calculation is performed is the length of the combined split wavelets. Separation may be achieved on synthetic data for wavelet delays as small as two sample intervals.",10.1190/1.1443524
Saturation-Path Dependency Of P-Wave Velocity And Attenuation In Sandstone Saturated With Co2 And Brine Revealed By Simultaneous Measurements Of Waveforms And X-Ray Computed Tomography Images,"We performed a laboratory experiment to measure compressional (P)-wave velocity and its attenuation in low-permeability striped sandstone at ultrasonic frequency during drainage (CO2 injection) and imbibition (brine injection). X-ray computed tomography (CT) images of the rock sample were simultaneously recorded during the injections. On the basis of the CT images, we calculated the CO2 saturation inside a prolate-spheroid-shaped volume (the first Fresnel zone) that enclosed the wave-propagation path. The relationship of P-wave velocity and that of attenuation to the CO2 fraction were then obtained. Both relationships showed nonuniqueness with remarkable hysteresis in a drainage-imbibition cycle. To explain the nonunique relationship of P-wave velocity to the CO2 fraction, we investigated the continuous random patchy saturation model by using exponent-type autocorrelation. The nonunique relationship of velocity to the CO2 fraction was explained by the model with a correlation length from an order of tens of millimeters in drainage to an order of hundreds of microns in imbibition. We also examined the potential influence of the fractal dimension of CO2 distribution by using the fractal patchy saturation model and a von-Kármán-type autocorrelation function. The fractal dimension of pore-space modulus as related to CO2 distribution was estimated on the basis of the CT images. The fractal dimension during imbibition found a larger value than that during drainage. The change in fractal dimension had a limited effect on velocity and attenuation changes. These nonunique relationships might have a significant impact on the use of seismic methods for estimation of CO2 volume in an inhomogeneous storage reservoir.",10.1190/geo2014-0289.1
Electromagnetic Depth Sounding Applied To Mining Problems,"A simplified approach to electromagnetic depth sounding in the variable coil separation mode is described. The method was developed by scale model studies and consideration of the geometry of the dipole magnetic field. Its use is limited to nonmagnetic, highly conductive plane structures or nonmagnetic thin sheets of moderate to high conductivity. Field tests indicate the method to be capable of providing good depth estimates over quite steeply dipping structures. The effect of conductivity anisotropy proved to be readily recognizable in the field tests.",10.1190/1.1440145
Prestack Phase-Shift Migration Of Separate Offsets In Laterally Inhomogeneous Media,"Using the stationary-phase method, prestack phase-shift migration is implemented one offset at a time. This separate-offset implementation allows for a Fourier (reasonably fast) wave-equation-type migration on data with irregular offset sampling. However, the separate-offset phase-shift migration, like its zero-offset counterpart, handles only vertically inhomogeneous media. Using the combination of the split-step and phase-shift-plus-interpolation (PSPI) approaches, the separate-offset phase-shift migration is extended to handle laterally inhomogeneous media. The cost of the separate-offset implementation is practically equivalent to that of the conventional zero-offset version. However, due to the lack of exact source and receiver ray-trajectory information in the separate-offset implementation, the combined split-step and PSPI handles only smooth lateral inhomogeneity. Specifically, it produces images equivalent to those resulting from smoothing the velocity model laterally over a window equal to the half offset. Thus, for zero-offset or laterally homogeneous media, the separate-offset migration is equivalent to any wave-equation-based migration. Errors might occur for finite-offset data in laterally inhomogeneous media. Such errors depend primarily on the strength of lateral inhomogeneity. Using this separate-offset phase-shift migration, accurate images of synthetic data of a model with large reflector dips and good images from real data from offshore Trinidad are obtained.",10.1190/1.3381884
Two‐Dimensional Automatic Resistivity Inversion Technique Using Alpha Centers,"I propose a method that uses alpha centers for two‐dimensional automatic analysis of dc electrical exploration data. Past papers on the alpha centers method have been concerned with relatively simple applications, such as identification of the location of anomalies; but by making a number of improvements on the method, complex two‐dimensional structures can be analyzed. The appropriateness of using negative C parameters in the alpha centers method is demonstrated by considering the resistivity and electric potential distribution expressed by the alpha centers. In this way, the structural expression of alpha centers is improved. Using a network of fixed alpha centers both stabilizes the analysis and makes it possible to employ a large number of alpha centers (more than 100). The combination of these improvements, compensation for topography, and application of a nonlinear least‐squares method, which has good convergence throughout the iteration process, makes automatic analysis possible. Three numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The first two simulate standard exploration from the ground surface. One is a simple prism model; the other, an inclined fault model. The final experiment simulates measurements between boreholes or adits. These experiments demonstrate that good results can be obtained by the alpha centers method, which has heretofore not been suitable for highly resistive structures or underground structures having sharp boundaries. Furthermore, the experiments show that this method has high resolution. Finally, the fact that one of the experiments shows the alpha centers method to be effective for cross‐borehole data analysis suggests its wide applicability. The applicability of the method is also demonstrated by two field experiments. The first identifies the form and distribution of lava in the ground, and the second investigates the distribution of intrusive rock and alteration zones in a steep, mountainous area.",10.1190/1.1442880
Interferometric Assessment Of Clamping Quality Of Borehole Geophones,"Borehole arrays are often preferred over surface installations for hydraulic-fracture monitoring of deep experiments due to their proximity to the treatment zone. Borehole geophone strings are typically clamped to the observation wellbore wall using electromechanical or magnetic devices in order for them to be in close contact with the surrounding formations and record the background noise and propagating wavefields related to the microseismic experiments. This contact needs to be maintained throughout the recording time. We have used seismic interferometry to assess the clamping quality of borehole geophone arrays. We determined that the characteristics of the retrieved crosscorrelation functions between a reference receiver and other receivers in an array are indicative of the clamping quality of the former geophone to the borehole wall. We have also defined the concept of separation frequency or emergence frequency as the frequency below which direct body waves propagating along the receiver line are clearly observed on the crosscorrelation gathers. The crosscorrelation gathers associated with poorly clamped geophones show predominantly tube waves or incoherent waveforms. Body waves only emerge below very low separation frequencies. The crosscorrelation gathers of relatively better coupled geophones, on the other hand, have higher separation frequencies. We have applied this method to four different borehole microseismic data sets, labeled here as A, B, C, and D, of which data set D was previously known to suffer from some clamping issues. Data sets B and C with inferred better coupling had separation frequencies of approximately 60 Hz, whereas the other two data sets are characterized by lower separation frequencies, 15 Hz for data set A and 20 Hz for data set D, suggesting relatively poorer coupling.",10.1190/geo2015-0193.1
Transient Electromagnetic Responses Of High‐Contrast Prisms In A Layered Earth,"An integral‐equation solution for transient electromagnetic (TEM) scattering by prisms in layered half‐spaces is formulated to provide meaningful results when the prisms are in highly resistive layers. A prism is replaced with an unknown scattering current, which is approximated with pulse and divergence‐free basis functions in the frequency domain. Divergence‐free basis functions model eddy currents that exist in confined bodies in a very resistive host and hence simulate the inductive responses of the prisms. A Galerkin solution for the scattering current is obtained where the dominant charge operator is eliminated from part of the solution by integrating the tensor Green's function around rectangular paths. After the scattering current is determined, the electric and magnetic fields scattered by the prisms are calculated; and the corresponding TEM responses are obtained by inverse Fourier transformation. The resulting solution provides meaningful results over a wide range of resistivities in layered hosts including the case of free space. The masking effect of a conductive overburden delays and suppresses the three‐dimensional TEM response of a conductor. The overburden response must be removed for the conductor's response to be fully interpretable. An interpretation of the conductor with free‐space models is a poor approximation when the basement rock is conductive. Instead of an exponential decay at late times, the conductor's response decays in an inverse power relationship. When the basement resistivity is increased, the conductor exhibits an exponential decay at late times. For a thin dike, the time constant estimated from this decay is identical to that for a thin plate in free space. However, the response of the dike buried beneath the overburden is larger than the response of the dike in free space. This increase in the response of the dike will bias modeling it in free space with thin plates. We have used the solution to gain insight regarding the lateral resolution of two vertical conductors for the fixed‐loop and central‐loop survey configurations. The results suggest that resolution of multiple conductors is very poor in a fixed‐loop survey; but in a central‐loop survey, the resolution is much better, provided the data are interpreted at early times. At later times, multiple conductors may not be resolvable and interpretational ambiguities could arise.",10.1190/1.1442503
On The Evolution Of The Elastic Properties Of Organic-Rich Shale Upon Pyrolysis-Induced Thermal Maturation,"The evolution of the elastic properties of organic-rich shale as a function of thermal maturity remains poorly constrained. This understanding is pivotal to the characterization of source rocks and unconventional reservoirs. To better constrain the evolution of the elastic properties and microstructure of organic-rich shale, we have studied the acoustic velocities and elastic anisotropy of samples from two microstructurally different organic-rich shales before and after pyrolysis-induced thermal maturation. To more physically imitate in situ thermal maturation, we performed the pyrolysis experiments on intact core plugs under applied reservoir-magnitude confining pressures. Iterative characterization of the elastic properties of a clay-rich, laminar Barnett Shale sample documents the development of subparallel to bedding cracks by an increase in velocity sensitivity to pressure perpendicular to the bedding. These cracks, however, are not visible through time-lapse scanning electron microscope imaging, indicating either submicrometer crack apertures or predominant development within the core of the sample. At elevated confining pressures, in the absence of pore pressure, these induced cracks close, at which point, the sample is acoustically indistinguishable from the prepyrolysis sample. Conversely, a micritic Green River sample does not exhibit the formation of aligned compliant features. Rather, the sample exhibits a largely directionally independent decrease in velocity as load-bearing, pore-filling kerogen is removed from the sample. Due to the weak alignment of minerals, there is comparatively little intrinsic anisotropy; further, due to the relatively directionally independent evolution of velocity, the evolution of the anisotropy as a function of thermal maturity is not indicative of aligned compliant features. Our results have indicated that horizons of greater thermal maturity may be acoustically detectable in situ through increases in the elastic anisotropy of laminar shales or decreases in the acoustic velocities of nonlaminar shales, micritic rocks, or siltstones.",10.1190/geo2015-0514.1
Determination Of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance T2 Cutoff Value Based On Multifractal Theory — An Application In Sandstone With Complex Pore Structure,"The cutoff value of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) transversal relaxation time T2 is vital for pore structure characterization, permeability prediction, and irreducible water saturation calculation. Conventional default values often lead to inaccurate results for rocks with complex pore structure. Based on NMR experiments and multifractal theory, we have developed an effective statistical method to predict T2 cutoff values without other petrophysical information. The method is based on multifractal theory to analyze the NMR T2 spectrum with the assumption that the T2 spectrum is an indicator of pore size distribution. Multifractal parameters, such as multifractal dimension, singularity strength, and mass exponent, are calculated to investigate the multifractal behavior of T2 spectrum via NMR experiments and a dyadic scaling-down algorithm. To obtain the optimal T2 cutoff value, the rotation speed and time of centrifugation are enlarged increasingly to optimal centrifugal state. A predicating model for T2 cutoff value based on multiple linear regressions of multifractal parameters was proposed after studying the influential factors. On the basis of the multifractal analysis of NMR T2 spectrum, a reasonable predication model for T2 cutoff value was rendered. Upon testing, the predicted results were highly consistent with the experimental results.",10.1190/geo2014-0140.1
"Marine Csem Of The Scarborough Gas Field, Part 2: 2D Inversion","We explored the application of 2D inversion of marine controlled-source electromagnetic and marine magnetotelluric data to image an ambiguous target. The Scarborough gas reservoir off the west coast of Australia lies in close repose to a layer in the overburden of similar resistivity-thickness product and also is not far above the resistive basement, making it a difficult electric target. We found that the standard 2D smooth-inversion method yielded models that were unable to resolve this ambiguous structural configuration. We solved this problem by developing a two-step workflow, in which we first invert for a coarse background resistivity model (e.g., anisotropic layers), then invert for the minimum deviation from this background using a much finer model discretization. The main purpose of our two-stage workflow is to inject the knowledge into the inversion that the subsurface is composed of self-similar geologic domains. Though the resulting models did not resolve fine-scale structural details, they might still be used to map the overall extent and bulk qualities of a target in an otherwise confounding setting.",10.1190/geo2014-0438.1
Offset-Continuation Stacking: Theory And Proof Of Concept,"The offset-continuation operation (OCO) is a seismic configuration transform designed to simulate a seismic section, as if obtained with a certain source-receiver offset using the data measured with another offset. Based on this operation, we have introduced the OCO stack, which is a multiparameter stacking technique that transforms 2D/2.5D prestack multicoverage data into a stacked common-offset (CO) section. Similarly to common-midpoint and common-reflection-surface stacks, the OCO stack does not rely on an a priori velocity model but provided velocity information itself. Because OCO is dependent on the velocity model used in the process, the method can be combined with trial-stacking techniques for a set of models, thus allowing for the extraction of velocity information. The algorithm consists of data stacking along so-called OCO trajectories, which approximate the common-reflection-point trajectory, i.e., the position of a reflection event in the multicoverage data as a function of source-receiver offset in dependence on the medium velocity and the local event slope. These trajectories are the ray-theoretical solutions to the OCO image-wave equation, which describes the continuous transformation of a CO reflection event from one offset to another. Stacking along trial OCO trajectories for different values of average velocity and local event slope allows us to determine horizon-based optimal parameter pairs and a final stacked section at arbitrary offset. Synthetic examples demonstrate that the OCO stack works as predicted, almost completely removing random noise added to the data and successfully recovering the reflection events.",10.1190/geo2015-0473.1
Resolution Comparison Of Minimum‐Phase And Zero‐Phase Signals,"Despite their intuitive appeal, minimum‐phase wavelets are not the shortest wavelets achievable on a seismic section. For several amplitude spectra typical of processed seismic sections, both minimum‐phase and zero‐phase wavelets are presented. In each case, several measures of length reveal that the zero‐phase wavelet is shorter than the minimum‐phase wavelet corresponding to the same amplitude spectrum. Furthermore, the zero‐phase wavelet has smaller side lobes than the corresponding minimum‐phase wavelet. Synthetic seismograms were generated using both the zero‐phase and minimum‐phase signals as inputs. In each case, the seismogram generated with the zero‐phase input signal had better resolution. This relation is demonstrated quantitatively and is also visually obvious on the seismograms. In addition to comparing the wavelets' resolution capabilities, the accuracies permitted in estimating reflection times were compared. The zero‐phase wavelets resulted in more accurate estimates of both reflection times and spacings.",10.1190/1.1440469
Nonhyperbolic Reflection Moveout In Anisotropic Media,"The standard hyperbolic approximation for reflection moveouts in layered media is accurate only for relatively short spreads, even if the layers are isotropic. Velocity anisotropy may significantly enhance deviations from hyperbolic moveout. Nonhyperbolic analysis in anisotropic media is also important because conventional hyperbolic moveout processing on short spreads is insufficient to recover the true vertical velocity (hence the depth). We present analytic and numerical analysis of the combined influence of vertical transverse isotropy and layering on long‐spread reflection moveouts. Qualitative description of nonhyperbolic moveout on ""intermediate"" spreads (offset‐to‐depth ratio x/z   1.7–2) is given in terms of the exact fourth‐order Taylor series expansion for P, SV, and P‐SV traveltime curves, valid for multilayered transversely isotropic media with arbitrary strength of anisotropy. We use this expansion to provide an analytic explanation for deviations from hyperbolic moveout, such as the strongly nonhyperbolic SV‐moveout observed numerically in the case where δ  ε. With this expansion, we also show that the weak anisotropy approximation becomes inadequate (to describe nonhyperbolic moveout) for surprisingly small values of the anisotropies δ and ε. However, the fourth‐order Taylor series rapidly loses numerical accuracy with increasing offset. We suggest a new, more general analytical approximation, and test it against several transversely isotropic models. For P‐waves, this moveout equation remains numerically accurate even for substantial anisotropy and large offsets. This approximation provides a fast and effective way to estimate the behavior of long‐spread moveouts for layered anisotropic models.",10.1190/1.1443686
Residual Depth Moveout And Velocity Determination For Parametric Media,"For the case when prestack depth migration has been performed with inaccurate velocities, it can be shown that second-order approximations can be used to predict the residual depth moveout of common-image and angle-domain common-image gathers. Corrections may be made in terms of offset and common-reflection angles that can be estimated from the migrated data using moveout analysis schemes. The residual moveout determined can be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the migrated data and to determine the variation of parameters of well-known formation-dependent velocity laws away from borehole positions. Although the method is developed for small offsets, reflection angles, and velocity differences, realistic examples may be used to demonstrate that satisfactory approximations to the residual moveout curve can be obtained over a relatively wide range of offsets or reflection angles and for moderate velocity differences. A zero-offset inversion was applied to the estimated residual radii of curvature. This inversion was performed layerwise. For each layer, the velocity was assumed to vary according to a known depth-varying and a laterally varying component to be determined. Iterative applications of the suggested approach have rendered satisfactory results for several representative velocity models. For each application, appropriate initial models were provided. Applications to initial models with large velocity differences and to seismic data with large offsets have to be investigated.",10.1190/1.2952916
Multidirectional Slowness Vector For Computing Angle Gathers From Reverse Time Migration,"Angle gathers are important for true-amplitude migration, migration velocity analysis, and angle-dependent inversion. Among existing methods, calculating the t-x direction vector is efficient, but it can give only one direction per grid point and fails to give multiple directions for overlapping wavefields associated with multipaths and reflections. The slowness vectors (SVs) in t-x and ω-k can be connected by Fourier transforms (FTs); the forward FT from t-x to ω-k decomposes the wavefields into different vector components, and the inverse FT sums these components into a unique direction. Therefore, the SV has multiple directions in ω-k, but it has only one direction in t-x. Based on this relation, we have separated the computation of propagation direction into two steps: First, we used the forward FT, k/ω binning, and several inverse FTs to separate the wavefields into vector subsets with different approximate propagation angles, which contained much less wave overlapping; then, we computed t-x SVs for each separated wavefield, and the set of these single-direction SVs constituted a multidirectional SV (MSV). In this process, the FTs between t and ω domains required a large input/output (I/O) time. We prove the conjugate relation between the decomposition results using positive- and negative-frequency wavefields, and we use complex-valued modeling to obtain the positive-frequency wavefields. Thus, we did wavefield decomposition in t-k instead of ω-k, and avoided the huge I/O caused by the FT between the t and ω domains. Our tests demonstrated that the MSV can give multiple directions for overlapping wavefields and improve the quality of angle gathers.",10.1190/geo2015-0134.1
Aeromagnetic Field Test Of Total Intensity Upward Continuation,"The theoretical basis for applying the upward‐continuation integral, T(x,y,z)=-z2π∫-∞∞∫-∞∞T(α,β)dαdβ[(x-α)2+(y-β)2+z2]3/2,z⩽0,  (1) to total magnetic intensity data T(α, β) measured on the plane z=0 has been recently reviewed by Henderson (1970). To perform upward continuation in the spatial domain, weights or coefficients obtained by numerical evaluation of equation (1) (Peters, 1949; Henderson, 1960; Fuller, 1967) may be convolved with the total intensity anomaly T(α, β) to produce T(x, y, z) at heights z0 (for z positive downward). The accuracy of upward continuation is, therefore, dependent on the validity of the numerical coefficients and of the assumptions required to show that T(α, β) satisfies the conditions of the Dirichlet problem for a plane. These assumptions are that the quantity sensed by a total‐intensity magnetometer is in the direction of the earth's normal field and that this direction is invariant over the area of interest.",10.1190/1.1440180
"High-Resolution 3D Shallow Crustal Structure In Long Beach, California: Application Of Ambient Noise Tomography On A Dense Seismic Array","Ambient noise tomography has proven to be effective in resolving shallow earth structure. We applied ambient noise tomography on a dense seismic array in Long Beach, California. The array was composed of more than 5200 stations with an average spacing close to 100 m. Three weeks of passive ambient noise were crosscorrelated between each station pair, which resulted in more than 13.5 million crosscorrelations within the area. Clear fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves were observed between 0.5 and 4 Hz, which were most sensitive to structure above 1-km depth. For each station pair, we applied frequency-time analysis to determine the phase traveltime dispersion, and, for each frequency, we applied eikonal tomography to determine the Rayleigh wave phase velocity map. The eikonal tomography accounted for ray bending by tracking the wavefront and allowed uncertainties to be estimated through statistical analysis. The compilation of phase velocity maps was then used to invert for 3D shear velocity structure. The inverted model showed clear correlation with the known geologic features such as the shallow south–north velocity dichotomy and a deeper fast anomaly associated with the Newport-Inglewood fault zone. Our results can potentially be used to complement traditional active source studies.",10.1190/geo2012-0453.1
"Discussion Of Paper By G. P. Woollard Entitled ""An Educational Program In Geophysics""","As this commentator pointed out originally in 1938, and at various times subsequently (Hubbert, 1938, 1946), the teaching of geophysics in the departments of geology as these were constituted up until 15 or 20 years ago was an almost impossible task. This was because it was then the custom, with few exceptions, for geology students to terminate their mathematical training at about trigonometry or college algebra, their physics either with no college physics at all or at most one year, and their chemistry after qualitative or quantitative analysis.",10.1190/1.1438175
Compressive Simultaneous Full-Waveform Simulation,"The fact that the computational complexity of wavefield simulation is proportional to the size of the discretized model and acquisition geometry and not to the complexity of the simulated wavefield is a major impediment within seismic imaging. By turning simulation into a compressive sensing problem, where simulated data are recovered from a relatively small number of independent simultaneous sources, we remove this impediment by showing that compressively sampling a simulation is equivalent to compressively sampling the sources, followed by solving a reduced system. As in compressive sensing, this reduces sampling rate and hence simulation costs. We demonstrate this principle for the time-harmonic Helmholtz solver. The solution is computed by inverting the reduced system, followed by recovering the full wavefield with a program that promotes sparsity. Depending on the wavefield's sparsity, this approach can lead to significant cost reductions, particularly when combined with the implicit preconditioned Helmholtz solver, which is known to converge even for decreasing mesh sizes and increasing angular frequencies. These properties make our scheme a viable alternative to explicit time-domain finite differences.",10.1190/1.3115122
The Use Of Quad–Quad Resistivity In Helicopter Electromagnetic Mapping,"We have studied the behavior of the quad–quad (apparent) resistivity and its comparison to in-phase–quad resistivity to determine the conditions under which the use of quad–quad resistivity is appropriate. For a two-layer earth, the behavior of the quad–quad resistivity depends mainly upon the ratio of the lower frequency fL to the upper-layer resistivity ρ1. If this ratio is low, the quad–quad resistivity will behave well. In areas yielding a high value of the ratio fL/ρ1, the quad–quad resistivity may lie outside of the range of the true resistivities of the earth and therefore provide misleading information. Our studies therefore suggest that the quad–quad resistivity algorithm should be avoided in areas where the ratio is large, i.e., when using high frequencies in conductive areas. The term large is relative. For a two-layer case, for example, the use of quad–quad resistivity is only recommended for magnetic areas where fL/ρ1  500 Hz/ohm-m, when conductive cover exists, and where fL/ρ1  50 Hz/ohm-m when a conductive basement underlies resistive cover. In spite of these limitations, quad–quad resistivity is often preferable to in-phase–quad resistivity in highly magnetic areas.",10.1190/1.1468605
Crosshole Ip Imaging For Engineering And Environmental Applications,"Induced polarization (IP) imaging is a promising tool in engineering and environmental studies. Application of this technique for near‐surface investigations has previously been limited by incomplete understanding of the physicochemical controls on the IP response, together with a lack of appropriate methods for data inversion. As laboratory studies have shown, description of IP in terms of complex electrical conductivity enables access to various structural characteristics pertinent to practical issues such as subsurface lithology definition, hydraulic permeability estimation, or hydrocarbon contaminant mapping. In particular, analysis in terms of real and imaginary conductivity components offers improved lithological characterization, since surface polarization effects are separated from electrolytic and surface conduction effects. An Occam‐type IP inversion algorithm based on complex algebra is described which accounts for these advances in IP interpretation by directly solving for complex conductivity. Results from crosshole applications at two case study sites demonstrate the suitability of the IP imaging approach for subsurface characterization. In the first case study, the imaging results correlate with the observed complex sequence of Quaternary sediments at a waste disposal site. Characterization of the polarizability of these sediments offers significant value in lithological differentiation. In the second case study, the results of IP imaging at a hydrocarbon‐contaminated site illustrate the potential of the method in environmental studies. The hydrocarbon location is clearly evident from the IP image, and a markedly different response is observed at an uncontaminated region of the site. By adopting empirical structural–electrical relationships, images of textural and hydraulic properties are estimated as a step toward improved quantitative characterization. The success of the method for these contrasting applications supports further investigation into understanding the physical and chemical processes that control observed IP.",10.1190/1.1649379
Three‐Dimensional Transient Electromagnetic Responses For A Grounded Source,"When the current in a grounded wire is terminated abruptly, currents immediately flow in the Earth to preserve the magnetic field. Initially the current is concentrated near the wire, with a broad zone of return currents below. The electric field maximum broadens and moves downward with time. Currents are channeled into a conductive three‐dimensional body, resulting in anomalous magnetic fields. At early times, when the return currents are channeled into the body, the vertical magnetic field is less than the half‐space field on the far side of the body but is greater than the half‐space field between the source and the body. Later the current in the body reverses; the vertical field is enhanced on the far side of the body and decreased between the source and the body. The horizontal magnetic field has a well‐defined maximum directly over the body at late times, and is a better indicator of the position of the body. The vertical magnetic field and its time derivative change sign with time at receiver locations near the source if a three‐dimensional body is present. These sign reversals present serious problems for one‐dimensional inversion, because decay curves for a layered earth do not change sign. At positions away from the source, the decay curves exhibit no sign reversals—only decreases and enhancements relative to one‐dimensional decay curves. In such cases one‐dimensional inversions may provide useful information, but they are likely to result in fictitious layers and erroneous interpretations.",10.1190/1.1442064
Anisotropy And Dispersion — Two Sides Of A Coin,"Anisotropy is the dependence of the velocity on direction; dispersion is the dependence of the velocity on frequency  f  (or wavelength  λ ). These apparently disjoint phenomena can be dealt with together if one uses as the common independent variable the wave vector   k= ki   , a vector in the direction of the wave and normal with length proportional to the wavenumber   ω∕V=2πf∕V=2π∕λ  . The phase velocity is   V=ω∕k   and the group velocity    gi = gradk (ω)   , the gradient of  ω  in  k -space. The most convenient display of anisotropy and dispersion is by surfaces of equal  ω  (or equal   f=ω∕2π  ), to be determined with the help of a dispersion equation. In isotropic conditions, theseiso-omega surfaces are spheres. If there is no dispersion, the spheres are equidistant. For wave-number regions with dispersion, the spheres have variable spacing. For anisotropic conditions, the iso-omega surfaces are nonspherical but similar and equispaced if the medi-um is nondispersive. If dispersion occurswith anisotropy, the iso-omega surfaces are not equispaced and not necessarily similar. For highlighting the long-wavelength limit of effective-media theories, a different display is advantageous: If one displays the iso-omega surfaces in slowness-vector space   (s=k∕ω)  , the iso-omega surfaces collapse into the long-wave slowness surface for the range of validity of the effective-media theory but deviate from the asymptotic slowness surface for frequencies beyond this range. Such displays not only allow quantification of the limits of the theory but also show in which directions and for which frequencies these deviations occur. The application of this concept requires that the dispersion equation be assembled from the solutions of the wave equation in the actual constituent media, not for the replacement medium. For instance, for a layered medium, the wavefield must satisfy the corresponding wave equation in each constituent layer and must be continuous across all interfaces.",10.1190/1.3052114
Elastic Waves Along A Cylindrical Bore,"This paper concerns axially symmetric solutions for waves propagating along a cylinder in an infinite elastic solid. Solutions are presented describing unattenuated propagation along the axis at phase velocities higher than shear and compressional speeds in the solid, in contradiction to earlier publications. Special attention is given to the limiting case of phase velocity equal to compressional speed in the solid, which at low frequencies very closely approximates the coupling of a fluid‐filled borehole to a plane compressional wave in the surrounding solid. Comparison with some experiments in a uniform section of Pierre shale show excellent agreement at low frequencies. In the low‐frequency limit, these solutions reduce to an approximate expression for borehole coupling published earlier by the author.",10.1190/1.1439019
Comparison Of Break‐Point And Time‐Intercept Methods In Refraction Calculations,"This paper compares two methods of calculating depths from refraction data where the subsurface consists of a series of horizontal layers with velocities V0V1V2, etc. Equations are developed for calculating depths from the horizontal distances to the intersections of the various segments of the time‐distance graph (the break‐points). Examples are worked out to show that the error in depth due to an uncorrected change in thickness of the weathered layer is much less when the depths are calculated from break‐points than when they are calculated from time‐intercepts. In many areas weathering corrections should be unnecessary if the depths can be calculated from the break‐points by the method outlined here.",10.1190/1.1438042

Quantitative Interpretation Of Gamma‐Ray Spectral Logs,"From calculations of the intensity of unscattered gamma rays inside cylindrical self‐absorbing sources, curves have been developed that aid in the application of gamma‐ray spectrometric techniques to borehole logging. Specifically, the curves provide factors which can be used to normalize spectral data to any standard set of borehole and formation conditions used for calibration. Taken into account are the effects of borehole diameter, mud density, casing and cement thickness, bed thickness, and detector eccentricity. Illustrative examples of applications of these curves depict the solutions to a variety of specific problems as well as methods for obtaining additional curves. Curves showing the portion of the log response due to gamma rays originating within specific zones of the formation provide an evaluation of the depth of investigation of the gamma‐ray spectral log.

A Versatile Algorithm For Joint 3D Inversion Of Gravity And Magnetic Data,"We describe the implementation of a versatile method for interpreting gravity and magnetic data in terms of 3D structures. The algorithm combines a number of features that have proven useful in other algorithms. To accommodate structures of arbitrary geometry, we define the subsurface using a large number of prisms, with the depths to the tops and bottoms as unknowns to be determined by optimization. Included in the optimization process are the three components of the magnetization vector and the density contrast, which is assumed to be a continuous function with depth. We use polynomial variations of the density contrast to simulate the natural increase of rock density with depth in deep sedimentary basins. The algorithm minimizes the quadratic norm of residuals combined with a regularization term. This term controls the roughness of the upper and lower topographies defined by the prisms. This results in simple shapes by penalizing the norms of the first and second horizontal derivatives of the prism depths and bottoms. Finally, with the use of quadratic programming, it is a simple matter to include a priori information about the model in the form of equality or inequality constraints. The method is first tested using a hypothetical model, and then it is used to estimate the geometry of the Ensenada basin by means of joint inversion of land and offshore gravity and land, offshore, and airborne magnetic data. The inversion helps constrain the structure of the basin and helps extend the interpretation of known surface faults to the offshore.",10.1190/1.1581067
Sensitivity-Kernel-Based Tomographic Migration Velocity Analysis Using Reverse Time Migration Angle-Image Gathers,"Sensitivity-kernel-based tomographic migration velocity analysis (TMVA) provides a means to better update the migration velocity model in complex media. For actual seismic data with finite-frequency bandwidth, migration velocity updated from wave-equation-based tomography is more suitable and robust than ray-based tomography for images obtained from reverse time migration (RTM). Depth residuals in the RTM-extracted angle-image gathers offer a reliable source of velocity information. We have developed cost-effective means of calculating the angle-domain sensitivity kernel and incorporated it into the TMVA approach using RTM angle-image gathers. The angle-domain sensitivity kernels are used to convert the depth residuals from RTM angle-image gathers into velocity perturbations, which were then used to refine the velocity model. We derived an approximate analytical residual moveout function for measuring depth residuals of the RTM angle-image gather in isotropic media and also devised a workflow for sensitivity-kernel-based TMVA. The workflow maintains the simplicity of ray-based tomography by replacing the rays with the more accurate angle-domain sensitivity kernels. We determined the capability of this method in updating migration velocity with the 2D Sigsbee2 model and the 3D SEAM model. Our method significantly improved the quality of the migrated depth image and flattened the RTM angle-image gathers.",10.1190/geo2014-0367.1
Skeletonization Of Aeromagnetic Data,"Skeletonization is a syntactic pattern‐recognition method that is applied to gridded data to produce an automatic line drawing, with an associated event catalog. Previous implementations of skeletonization have been tailored for seismic data. Here, we modify that technique to render it more suitable for other types of gridded data, with particular emphasis on aeromagnetic maps. A modification from previous schemes is the use of a two‐pass approach, to reduce the effects of an otherwise problematic directional bias that discriminates against events oriented parallel to columns of the grid. The method can be used effectively for filtering aeromagnetic data on the basis of strike direction, event linearity, event amplitude, and polarity. It is based on the delineation of peak‐trough pairs (cycles), which are traced throughout the grid to form contiguous events. Cycles and events are characterized by attributes that include amplitude, polarity, and pulse width. Events are further characterized by length, average strike direction, and linearity. The event attributes are stored in a catalog, thus enabling one to perform attribute‐based analysis and data filtering. We illustrate our algorithm using two regional aeromagnetic examples from different parts of the Canadian Shield. The first, from the Great Slave Lake shear zone, is dominated by linear anomaly trends produced by faults and mafic dikes. The second, from the Manicouagan region of northeastern Quebec, contains abundant subcircular and arcuate anomaly patterns caused by large intrusive complexes and a meteorite impact structure.",10.1190/1.1707068
Frequency‐Wavenumber Inversion Of Acoustic Data,"We describe an inversion procedure for obtaining velocities, densities, and layer thicknesses from multioffset reflection seismograms generated by a point source excitation in a stratified acoustic medium. The reference seismograms are decomposed into cylindrical waves in the frequency‐wavenumber domain, where the inversion is performed by minimizing the difference between the reference data and modeled data using a least‐squares technique. The modeling algorithm is based on the classical reflectivity method. We include the effects of limited temporal and spatial apertures by applying a frequency and wavenumber dependent filter in the modeling process. This inversion is suited for Jacobian matrix methods where the first derivatives of the model‐generated data with respect to the model parameters are calculated from analytical expressions together with the modeling. The numerical examples show that the inversion algorithm recovers with reasonable accuracy the parameters used to generate the reference data. The low frequency trends of both the velocity and the density are restored. The convergence of the iterative minimization algorithm is fast.",10.1190/1.1443111
Amplitude Variations With Offset Of Pressure‐Seal Reflections,"Knowledge of pressure compartments is essential for identifying potential risks in advance of drilling and in understanding the mechanism of hydrocarbon trapping and migration. These compartments are bounded by pressure seals which, under certain conditions, can be detected and characterized with seismic reflection data. Use of prestack seismic data requires the analysis of reflections generated at the pressure seals, such as the top of a reservoir, rather than the properties of the rock volume. In this sense, amplitude variations with offset (AVO) techniques can be a good tool to obtain information from such pressure seals or pressure transition zones. In this work, I investigate the AVO response of compartment seals by analyzing the plane‐wave reflection coefficients as a function of pore pressure (above and below the seal), incidence angle, and seal thickness. For the case investigated in this work (Berea sandstone with high gas saturation), the AVO effects are important at low effective pressures, that is, when the pore pressure approaches the confining pressure. In shale‐free transition zones, the anomaly is, in general, negative, whereas in shale/sandstone sequences, the anomaly can be positive or negative depending on seal thickness and formation pressure. In terms of the four‐category classification for AVO crossplotting, the PP anomalies are mainly class IV and class I.",10.1190/1.1444907
Robust Polynomial Fitting Method For Regional Gravity Estimation,"Standard polynomial fitting methods are inconsistent in their formulation. The regional field is approximated by a polynomial fitted to the observed field. As a result, in addition to the nonuniqueness in the definition of the regional field, the fitted polynomial is strongly influenced by the residual field (observed field minus regional field). We present a regional‐residual separation method for gravity data which uses a robust procedure to determine the coefficients of a polynomial fitted to the observations. Under the hypothesis that the regional can be modeled correctly by the polynomial surface, the proposed method minimizes the influence of the residual field in the fitted surface. The proposed method was applied to real gravity data from Ceará state, Brazil, and produced information on zones of possible crustal thickening and the occurrence of lower‐crustal granulitic rocks thrust into the shallow subsurface.",10.1190/1.1442960
Basic Probabilistic Methods In Geological Search,An exposition of the basic mathematical methods used in calculating the probability of successful search for geological structures in a discrete set of regions is given. The argument is framed without the restrictive assumption of a specific distribution for the conditional probability of discovery but is subsequently illustrated by the specific case of a Poisson distribution. The optimal allocation of search effort to the various regions is determined. The important question of how the probabilities of occurrence of deposits should be adjusted after unsuccessful search is specifically answered by calculation of the a posteriori probabilities.,10.1190/1.1439316
Quasi‐Static Transient Response Of A Conducting Permeable Sphere,"When a conducting body is immersed in a time‐varying magnetic field, eddy currents are induced. These, in turn, produce a secondary magnetic field which may be detected by an observer external to the sphere. It has been demonstrated that a measurement of the external field can be used to estimate the conductivity of the body if certain assumptions are valid. For example, Ward (1953) has shown that the conductivity and permeability of geological core specimens from diamond drill holes may be determined by examining the frequency dependence of the time‐harmonic response of the specimen. In principle, the same information should also be available from the time response of the specimen for a suddenly applied magnetic field (Wait, 1951). In this paper, we wish to discuss the transient solution when a homogeneous conducting sphere is under the influence of a transient magnetic field. Also, as suggested earlier by Wait (1951), the actual time‐domain electromagnetic response of a massive sulfide body should exhibit features akin to this transient solution. Thus, the results should have application in mining geophysics. We consider both a nonpermeable and a permeable sphere, using a different approach for each. Because the former is a special case of the latter, a consistency check is obtained.",10.1190/1.1440051
Avo For One- And Two-Fracture Set Models,"A theoretical comparison is made of PP and PS angle–dependent reflection coefficients at the top of two fractured-reservoir models using exact, general, anisotropic reflection coefficients. The two vertical-fracture models are taken to have the same total crack density. The primary issue investigated is determination of the fracture orientation using azimuthal AVO analysis. The first model represents a single-fracture set and the second model has an additional fracture set oblique to the first set at an angle of 60°. As expected, the PP-wave anisotropy is reduced when multiple fracture sets are present, making the determination of orientation more difficult than for the case of a single-fracture set. Long offsets are required for identification of dominant fracture orientations using PP-wave AVO. PS-wave AVO, however, is quite sensitive to fracture orientations, even at short offsets. For multiple-fracture sets, PS signals can potentially be used to determine orientations of the individual sets.",10.1190/1.1884825
A Problem In The Analysis Of Geophysical Data,"The problem is to analyze mapped data into components which may be termed ""trend"" and ""residual."" The approach used is polynomial fitting by least squares, following the method of DeLury when the data are evenly distributed (or sampled), and of Kendall when they are not. The DeLury method, however, is extended somewhat in scope to include missing values. A number of statistical tests are discussed which should assist in determining the optimum amount of complexity to ascribe to ""trend."" The attitude taken throughout this paper is unbiased in the sense that positive and negative residuals are held a priori to be equally likely. An example is given of the regional correction of a gravity survey designed to explore for sulphides near Val d'Or, Quebec. In conclusion, a brief discussion is given of the advantages of polynomial fitting over smoothing and ""gridding"" methods from the point of view of labour and costs.",10.1190/1.1438363
Geometrical Spreading Corrections Of Offset Reflections In A Laterally Inhomogeneous Earth,"Compressional primary seismic nonzero offset reflections are the most essential wavefield attributes used in seismic parameter estimation and imaging. We show how the determination of angle‐dependent reflection coefficients can be addressed from identifying such events for arbitrarily curved three‐dimensional (3-D) subsurface reflectors below a laterally inhomogeneous layered overburden. More explicitly, we show how the geometrical‐spreading factor along a reflected primary ray with offset can be calculated from the identified (i.e., picked) traveltimes of offset primary reflections. Seismic traces in which all primary reflections are corrected with the geometrical‐spreading factor are, as is well‐known, referred to as true‐amplitude traces. They can be constructed without any knowledge of the velocity distribution in the earth model. Apart from possibly finding a direct application in an amplitude‐versus‐offset (AVO) analysis, the theory developed here can be of use to derive true‐amplitude time‐ and depth‐migration methods for various seismic data acquisition configurations, which pursue the aim of performing the wavefield migration (based upon the use of a macro‐velocity model) and the AVO analysis in one step.",10.1190/1.1443317
High-Resolution Wave-Equation Amplitude-Variation-With-Ray-Parameter (Avp) Imaging With Sparseness Constraints,"We propose a new scheme for high-resolution amplitude-variation-with-ray-parameter (AVP) imaging that uses nonquadratic regularization. We pose migration as an inverse problem and propose a cost function that uses a priori information about common-image gathers (CIGs). In particular, we introduce two regularization constraints: smoothness along the offset-ray-parameter axis and sparseness in depth. The two-step regularization yields high-resolution CIGs with robust estimates of AVP. We use an iterative reweighted least-squares conjugate gradient algorithm to minimize the cost function of the problem. We test the algorithm with synthetic data (a wedge model and the Marmousi data set) and a real data set (Erskine area, Alberta). Tests show our method helps to enhance the vertical resolution of CIGs and improves amplitude accuracy along the ray-parameter direction.",10.1190/1.2387139
Antileakage Fourier Transform For Seismic Data Regularization,"Seismic data regularization, which spatially transforms irregularly sampled acquired data to regularly sampled data, is a long-standing problem in seismic data processing. Data regularization can be implemented using Fourier theory by using a method that estimates the spatial frequency content on an irregularly sampled grid. The data can then be reconstructed on any desired grid. Difficulties arise from the nonorthogonality of the global Fourier basis functions on an irregular grid, which results in the problem of ""spectral leakage"": energy from one Fourier coefficient leaks onto others. We investigate the nonorthogonality of the Fourier basis on an irregularly sampled grid and propose a technique called ""antileakage Fourier transform"" to overcome the spectral leakage. In the antileakage Fourier transform, we first solve for the most energetic Fourier coefficient, assuming that it causes the most severe leakage. To attenuate all aliases and the leakage of this component onto other Fourier coefficients, the data component corresponding to this most energetic Fourier coefficient is subtracted from the original input on the irregular grid. We then use this new input to solve for the next Fourier coefficient, repeating the procedure until all Fourier coefficients are estimated. This procedure is equivalent to ""reorthogonalizing"" the global Fourier basis on an irregularly sampled grid. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of this technique with successful applications to both synthetic and real data examples.",10.1190/1.1993713
Practical Implementation Of Three‐Dimensional Poststack Depth Migration,"This work deals with the practical aspects of three‐dimensional (3-D) poststack depth migration. A method, based on depth extrapolation in the frequency domain, is used for the migration. This method is suitable for structures with arbitrary velocity variation, and the number of computations required can be directly related to the complexity of the given velocity function. We demonstrate the superior computational efficiency of this method for 3-D depth migration relative to the reverse‐time migration method. The computational algorithm used for the migration is designed for a multi‐processor machine (Cray-XMP/48) and takes advantage of advanced disk technologies to overcome the input/output (I/O) problem. The method is demonstrated with both synthetic and field data. The migration of a typical 3-D data volume can be accomplished in only a few hours.",10.1190/1.1442656
Differential Reduction Of Magnetic Anomalies To The Pole On A Massively Parallel Computer,"Application of this tool to magnetic anomalies in east China reveals that the northward shift in position of the anomaly maximum generated by DRTP is 6 km for anomalies with dominant wavelengths of approximately 25 km in the northernmost part of the study area. The shift increases as the anomaly wavelength increases. Shifts for all anomaly wavelengths are even larger in the southern part of the study area, where the magnetic inclination is lower. The shift in position of the anomaly maximum for anomalies of wavelengths 25 km in the northernmost area produced by DRTP is 2 km less than that produced by a conventional reduction to the pole using the inclination and declination at the central location of the study area. Once again, such differences in shifts are larger for anomalies of longer wavelengths. The farther away from the central location, the greater is the absolute value of the difference.",10.1190/1.1635048
Basic Equations For Synthetic Seismograms Using The Z‐Transform Approach,"In the past few years several papers have been published on the z‐transform approach to the problem of seismic wave propagation in layered media. Although these papers start with the same fundamental equations, small differences in notation make the study of the synthetic seismograms derived in these papers time consuming. In order to aid the reader, the present note gives the basic equations as well as tables which show the correspondence for the main symbols used in the papers of Goupillaud (1961), Kunetz (1964) Sherwood and Trorey (1965), Treitel and Robinson (1966), Robinson (1967), and Claerbout (1968).",10.1190/1.1439949
Fast 2-D Ray+Born Migration/Inversion In Complex Media,"In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of a fast 2-D ray+Born migration/inversion algorithm to recover the true amplitude of the model parameters in 2-D complex media. The method is based on a quasi‐Newtonian linearized inversion of the scattered wavefield. Asymptotic Green's functions are computed in a smooth reference model with a dynamic ray tracing based on the wavefront construction method. The model is described by velocity perturbations associated with diffractor points. Both the first traveltime and the strongest arrivals can be inverted. The algorithm is implemented with several numerical approximations such as interpolations and aperture limitation around common midpoints to speed the algorithm. Both theoritical and numerical aspects of the algorithm are assessed with three synthetic and real data examples including the 2-D Marmousi example. Comparison between logs extracted from the exact Marmousi perturbation model and the computed images shows that the amplitude of the velocity perturbations are recovered accurately in the regions of the model where the ray field is single valued. In the presence of caustics, neither the first traveltime nor the most energetic arrival inversion allow for a full recovery of the amplitudes although the latter improves the results. We conclude that all the arrivals associated with multipathing through transmission caustics must be taken into account if the true amplitude of the perturbations is to be found. Only 22 minutes of CPU time is required to migrate the full 2-D Marmousi data set on a Sun SPARC 20 workstation. The amplitude loss induced by the numerical approximations on the first traveltime and the most energetic migrated images are evaluated quantitatively and do not exceed 8% of the energy of the image computed without numerical approximation. Computational evaluation shows that extension to a 3-D ray+Born migration/inversion algorithm is realistic.",10.1190/1.1444513
Precise Measurement Of Deep Electrical Anomalies,"A method of electrical prospecting has been developed in which the deleterious effects of superficial inhomogeneities in resistivity are eliminated. An electrode configuration is used consisting of a current electrode at ""infinity,"" a pair of current electrodes with a constant separation of a few hundred feet which are used alternately, and a pair of potential electrodes with a constant separation of a few hundred feet, collinear with the pair of current electrodes, and at a distance from them which is varied to secure depth resolution. It is demonstrated that superficial influences are eliminated by forming the resistivity increment, the ratio between apparent resistivity determined by use of the closer current electrode of the alternate pair and that determined by use of the farther current electrode of the alternate pair. It is also demonstrated that the area explored is below a point approximately half‐way between the alternate pair of current electrodes. Resistivity increment curves, called Resistologs by the authors, can be correlated from station to station, and after they are correlated the lateral variation in the electrical properties of selected subsurface zones can be studied. As a result of the latter characteristic of the measurements, a possibility exists for the direct location of oil and gas, observational evidence for which is presented. The results of surveys made in Hart County, Kentucky, and in the Sam Fordyce, Seven Sisters, Pettus, Branyon, Dunlap, Oakville, and Rhode Ranch fields of Southwest Texas are displayed.",10.1190/1.1445089
Assessing Estimated Velocity-Depth Models: Finding Error Bars In Tomographic Inversion,"In conventional migration velocity analysis methods, a velocity model is estimated that results in flattened events in common-image gathers. However, after this process, no information is available on the accuracy of this velocity model. A statistical analysis of velocity-model parameters is very difficult because of the integrated nature of the process. In common-focus-point technology, velocity estimation is split into two processes: a first step to estimate one-way focusing operators from the seismic data and a second step to translate these one-way propagation operators into a velocity-depth model. Because the second step does not involve seismic data and uses a hands-off model parameterization, a statistical analysis of the inversion result becomes rather straightforward. We developed a methodology for obtaining a suite of possible solutions, from which statistical measures can be extracted. By varying initial settings, the inversion of one-way traveltimes provides a space of solutions. Rather than having a single estimated model, we can obtain an ensemble of models. By performing statistical analysis of this ensemble, the error bars of the estimated velocity model can be retrieved. The procedure was tested for a 2D synthetic and field data set, for which the latter compares favorably to a conventional two-way traveltime tomography approach. The information provided by such an analysis is important because it shows the reliability of the final estimated model and could provide feedback for acquisition geometry design. More or better data might be needed to obtain a model to which a smaller degree of ambiguity is associated.",10.1190/1.2951469
Data‐Adaptive Polarization Filters For Multichannel Geophysical Data,"The design of data‐adaptive filters requires that the noise be defined, statistically or otherwise, by parameters which allow some means of separating the noise from the signal. We consider here multichannel data in which one knows only that the noise is less polarized than the signal in a unitary space. This description of the noise is not sufficient for designing filters which are optimum in any sense; consequently, the filters may require a number of changes in the parameters before a satisfactory design can be found. Once this design has been achieved, the filters can be used to enhance waveforms of arbitrary shape, requiring little prior knowledge of the spectral content or temporal features of the signal. In contrast to many other data‐adaptive filters which give a scalar time‐series output, the filters we describe here with vector time series input have an equal number of input and output channels. A number of examples of filtered magnetic and seismic data are given in order to emphasize the wide range of uses for the filters. Some suggestions for application of the filters to multichannel seismic data are given.",10.1190/1.1441149
Traveltime Inversion Of Both Direct And Reflected Arrivals In Vertical Seismic Profile Data,"Traveltimes from both direct and reflected arrivals in a VSP data set (Bridenstein no. 1 well in Oklahoma) are inverted in a least‐squares sense for velocity structure. By comparing the structure from inversion to the sonic log, we conclude that the accuracy of the reconstructed velocities is greater than that found when only the direct arrivals are used. Extensive tests on synthetic VSP data confirm this observation. Apparently, the additional reflection traveltime equations aid in averaging out the traveltime errors, as well as reducing the slowness variance in reflecting layers. These results are consistent with theory, which predicts a decrease in a layer's slowness variance with an increase in the number and length of terminating reflected rays. For the Bridenstein data set, 130 direct traveltimes and 399 primary reflection traveltimes were used in the inversion.",10.1190/1.1442576
Spectral‐Domain Decomposition Methods For The Solution Of Acoustic And Elastic Wave Equations,"A new spectral‐domain decomposition method is presented for acoustic and elastodynamic wave propagation in 2-D heterogeneous media. Starting from a variational formulation of the problem, two different approaches are proposed for the spatial discretization: a mixed Fourier‐Legendre and a full Legendre collocation. The matching conditions at subdomain interfaces are carefully analyzed, and the stability and efficiency of time‐advancing schemes are investigated. The numerical validation with some significant test cases illustrates the accuracy, flexibility, and robustness of our methods. These allow the treatment of complex geometries and heterogeneous media while retaining spectral accuracy.",10.1190/1.1444036
"Use Of Refraction, Reflection, And Wave-Equation-Based Tomography For Imaging Beneath Shallow Gas: A Trinidad Field Data Example","Shallow localized gas pockets cause challenging problems in seismic imaging because of sags and wipe-out zones they produce on imaged reflectors deep in the section. In addition, the presence of shallow gas generates strong surface-related and interbed multiples, making velocity updating very difficult. When localized gas pockets are very shallow, we have limited information to build a near-surface velocity model using ray-based reflection tomography alone. Diving-wave refraction tomography successfully builds a starting model for the very shallow part. Usual ray-based reflection tomography using single-parameter hyperbolic moveout might need many iterations to update the deeper part of the velocity model. In addition, the method generates a low-velocity anomaly in the deeper part of the model. We present an innovative method for building the final velocity model by combining refraction, reflection, and wave-equation-based tomography. Wave-equation-based tomography effectively generates a detailed update of a shallow velocity field, resolving the gas-sag problem. When applied as the last step, following the refraction and reflection tomography, it resolves the gas-sag problem but fails to remove the low-velocity anomaly generated by the reflection tomography in the deeper part of the model. To improve the methodology, we update the shallow velocity field using refraction tomography followed by wave-equation tomography before updating the deeper part of the model. This step avoids generating the low-velocity anomaly. Refraction and wave-equation-based tomography followed by reflection tomography generates a simpler velocity model, giving better focusing in the deeper part of the image. We illustrate how the methodology successfully improves resolution of gas anomalies and significantly reduces gas sag from an imaged section in the Greater Cassia area, Trinidad.",10.1190/1.2953064
The Seismic Wave Energy Reflected From Various Types Of Stratified Horizons,"Two applications are made of the reflection and transmission coefficients reported in the preceding paper. These concern the effect of the angle of incidence upon the fraction of incident energy returning to the surface, and the effect of velocity stratification upon the energy return.",10.1190/1.1441798
Simultaneous Reverse Time Migration Of Primaries And Free-Surface Related Multiples Without Multiple Prediction,"Prestack reverse time migration (RTM) is usually regarded as an accurate imaging tool and has been widely used in exploration. Conventional RTM only uses primaries and treats free-surface related multiples as noise; however, free-surface related multiples can sometimes provide extra illumination of the subsurface, and this information could be used in migration procedures. There are many migration methods using free-surface related multiples, but most approaches need to predict multiples, which is time consuming and prone to error. We discovered a new RTM approach that uses the primaries and the free-surface related multiples simultaneously. Compared with migration methods that only use free-surface related multiples, the proposed approach can provide comparable migration results and does not need multiple predictions. In our approach, the source function in conventional RTM was replaced with recorded field data including primaries and free-surface related multiples, together with a synthetic wavelet; the back-propagated primaries in the conventional RTM were replaced with complete recorded field data. The imaging condition of the proposed approach was the same as the crosscorrelation imaging condition of conventional RTM. A three-layer velocity model with scatterers and the Sigsbee 2B synthetic data set were used for numerical experiments. The numerical results showed that the proposed approach can cover a wider range of the subsurface and provide better illumination compared with conventional RTM. The proposed approach was easy to implement and avoided tedious multiple prediction; it might be significant for general complex subsurface imaging.",10.1190/geo2012-0450.1
Study Of A Three‐Dimensional Seismic Detection System,"As part of the VELA program for evaluating systems for detecting underground nuclear events, a three‐dimensional seismic array was instrumented and operated for over a year. Three seismometers spaced 1,320 ft apart were clamped to casing in each of five abandoned oil wells near Tryon, Oklahoma, and their outputs individually recorded on magnetic tape and conventional oscillograms. By time‐shifting and compositing to achieve optimum signal coherence, signal‐to‐noise improvement factors somewhat greater than n times the ratio for a surface detector were obtained in the signal spectrum from 4 to 10 cps, with lower improvement factors in the 1‐ to 4‐cps range. Studies of the nature of the site noise and its attenuation characteristics with depth are presented together with autocorrelation, power‐spectrum, and coherence plots. To a depth of approximately 1,300 ft, the noise decay is exponential and characteristic of the fundamental Rayleigh mode. Below this depth the pattern is more complex and may be representative of higher mode Rayleigh and body waves. Expressions were derived for the theoretical comparison of the relative directional response of two‐ and three‐dimensional arrays. This study was sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.",10.1190/1.1439354
Least Squares Determination Of The Velocity Function V=V0+Kz For Any Set Of Time Depth Data,A method is presented by means of which a least square fit of the circular ray path plotting function to time‐depth data is obtained. An example is worked out illustrating the application of the method to an actual case.,10.1190/1.1445056
Elimination Of Harmonic Distortion In Vibroseis Data,"We present a new approach to eliminate the harmonic distortion in vibroseis data. This technique is based on the definition of the sweep for the case where the instantaneous frequency varies linearly with time. The method requires no more than the computation of a purely deterministic phase‐shift filter that has the phase spectrum of a hypothetical ""kth harmonic distortion."" With this particular phase‐shift filter, all harmonic distortions in the base‐plate signal and those caused by the first strong arrival in the vibroseis trace (which leads to the ""correlation ghost sweeps"") are removed. The process consists of (1) applying the deterministic pure phase‐shift filter to the vibroseis trace and the base‐plate signal; (2) setting time values equal to zero for negative times in both the filtered base‐plate signal and the filtered vibroseis trace; and (3) applying the inverse pure phase‐shift filter to both base‐plate signal and vibroseis trace prior to performing the usual crosscorrelation. The correlated trace thus obtained will be freed substantially of correlation noise; i.e., the correlation‐ghost sweeps (produced by severe harmonic distortion both at negative and positive correlation times) are eliminated without degrading the seismic information content of the trace. The new method of elimination has been successfully applied to synthetic and real harmonically distorted vibroseis data and is compared with the standard correlation technique that uses the pilot sweep as the correlator.",10.1190/1.1443787
P-Wave Anisotropy From Azimuthal Avo And Velocity Estimates Using 3D Seismic Data From Saudi Arabia,"A horizontal well is most productive in tight reservoirs when it intersects a large number of vertical fractures, yet strata near the borehole remain mechanically stable. Azimuthal velocity analysis and P-wave amplitude versus offset (AVO) using 3D wide-azimuth prestack surface seismic data provide a remote yet detailed way to map a fracture pattern away from well control. We estimate fracture direction and relative fracture intensity from such data at two gas fields in Saudi Arabia. Our results show a small azimuthal variation in P-wave velocity (maximum 5%) and a larger variation in azimuthal AVO at the reservoir (larger than 100%). Computed fracture attributes for field 1 show a consistent east-west fracture direction. However, in field 2, fracture azimuth is variable but generally east-west and north-south, with the strongly anisotropic north-south orientation correlating with faults and areas of large structural curvature in the reservoir. In both fields, azimuthal AVO analysis shows a more consistent estimate of fracture orientation than velocity analysis. These estimates have been instrumental in planning prolific and safe horizontal wells",10.1190/1.2187724
Seismic Sparse-Spike Deconvolution Via Toeplitz-Sparse Matrix Factorization,"We have developed a new sparse-spike deconvolution (SSD) method based on Toeplitz-sparse matrix factorization (TSMF), a bilinear decomposition of a matrix into the product of a Toeplitz matrix and a sparse matrix, to address the problems of lateral continuity, effects of noise, and wavelet estimation error in SSD. Assuming the convolution model, a constant source wavelet, and the sparse reflectivity, a seismic profile can be considered as a matrix that is the product of a Toeplitz wavelet matrix and a sparse reflectivity matrix. Thus, we have developed an algorithm of TSMF to simultaneously deconvolve the seismic matrix into a wavelet matrix and a reflectivity matrix by alternatively solving two inversion subproblems related to the Toeplitz wavelet matrix and sparse reflectivity matrix, respectively. Because the seismic wavelet is usually compact and smooth, the fused Lasso was used to constrain the elements in the Toeplitz wavelet matrix. Moreover, due to the limitations of computer memory, large seismic data sets were divided into blocks, and the average of the source wavelets deconvolved from these blocks via TSMF-based SSD was used as the final estimation of the source wavelet for all blocks to deconvolve the reflectivity; thus, the lateral continuity of the seismic data can be maintained. The advantages of the proposed deconvolution method include using multiple traces to reduce the effect of random noise, tolerance to errors in the initial wavelet estimation, and the ability to preserve the complex structure of the seismic data without using any lateral constraints. Our tests on the synthetic seismic data from the Marmousi2 model and a section of field seismic data demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively derive the wavelet and reflectivity simultaneously from band-limited data with appropriate lateral coherence, even when the seismic data are contaminated by noise and the initial wavelet estimation is inaccurate.",10.1190/geo2015-0151.1
Robust And Least‐Squares Estimation Of Acoustic Attenuation From Well‐Log Data,"Several least‐squares attenuation (Q) estimation algorithms are tested on various types of models. These algorithms include the spectral ratio method and methods based upon eigenvector decomposition and Wiener filtering. The eigenvector decomposition and Wiener filter methods prove to be unsatisfactory even on model data, while the spectral ratio method yields fairly poor results. Tests indicate that the underlying Q error distribution is non‐Gaussian; hence more robust methods are needed. The errors in Q estimation have an asymptotically Cauchy distribution, with a reasonable noise model and Gaussian input noise. On noise models with Gaussian errors slightly contaminated by Cauchy or Laplacian noise, a maximum‐likelihood (ML) estimator based on Gaussian noise performed best. On heavily contaminated models, the ML estimator based on Laplacian noise performed best; but simple, robust estimators such as the median also did well. On more realistic models with noise, the median and alpha‐trimmed mean (ATM) appear to be the best.",10.1190/1.1442563
"An Integrated Surface Seismic/Seismic Profile Case Study: Simonette Area, Alberta","On the basis of conventional surface seismic data, the 13–15–63–25W5M exploratory well was drilled into a low‐relief Leduc Formation reef (Devonian Woodbend Group) in the Simonette area, west‐central Alberta, Canada. The well was expected to intersect the crest of the reef and encounter about 50–60 m of pay; unfortunately it was drilled into a flank position and abandoned. The decision to abandon the well, as opposed to whipstocking in the direction of the reef crest, was made after the acquisition and interpretive processing of both near( and far‐offset (252 and 524 m, respectively) vertical seismic profile (VSP) data, and after the reanalysis of existing surface seismic data. The near‐ and far‐offset VSPs were run and interpreted while the drill rig remained on‐site, with the immediate objectives of: (1) determining an accurate tie between the surface seismic data and the subsurface geology; and (2) mapping relief along the top of the reef over a distance of 150 m from the 13–15 well location in the direction of the adjacent productive 16–16 well (with a view to whipstocking). These surveys proved to be cost‐effective in that the operators were able to determine that the crest of the reef was out of the target area, and that whipstocking was not a viable alternative. The use of VSP surveys in this situation allowed the operators to avoid the costs associated with whipstocking, and to feel confident with their decision to abandon the well.",10.1190/1.1443383
"Identification Of Gas Hydrate Dissociation From Wireline-Log Data In The Shenhu Area, South China Sea","Wireline logs were acquired in eight wells during China's first gas hydrate drilling expedition (GMGS-1) in April–June of 2007. Well logs obtained from site SH3 indicated gas hydrate was present in the depth range of 195–206 m below seafloor with a maximum pore-space gas hydrate saturation, calculated from pore water freshening, of about 26%. Assuming gas hydrate is uniformly distributed in the sediments, resistivity calculations using Archie's equation yielded hydrate-saturation trends similar to those from chloride concentrations. However, the measured compressional (P-wave) velocities decreased sharply at the depth between 194 and 199 mbsf, dropping as low as 1.3  km/s, indicating the presence of free gas in the pore space, possibly caused by the dissociation of gas hydrate during drilling. Because surface seismic data acquired prior to drilling were not influenced by the in situ gas hydrate dissociation, surface seismic data could be used to identify the cause of the low P-wave velocity observed in the well log. To determine whether the low well-log P-wave velocity was caused by in situ free gas or by gas hydrate dissociation, synthetic seismograms were generated using the measured well-log P-wave velocity along with velocities calculated assuming both gas hydrate and free gas in the pore space. Comparing the surface seismic data with various synthetic seismograms suggested that low P-wave velocities were likely caused by the dissociation of in situ gas hydrate during drilling.",10.1190/geo2011-0324.1
An Approximate Solution Of The Problem Of Maximum Depth In Gravity Interpretation,"It is assumed that the maximum depth for the mass responsible for a given gravity anomaly is closely approximated by the depth to the top of the vertical‐sided mass (prism or cylinder, as the case may be) whose calculated anomaly gives the closest fit to the observed anomaly, and whose density contrast is the maximum permitted from geological considerations. A set of charts is presented by means of which the depth and dimensions of the prism (or cylinder) of ""best fit"" can be determined quickly from the amplitude, half‐maximum, and three‐quarter maximum widths of the anomaly, together with the assumed density contrast. Four examples are given of the use of the method with actual data.",10.1190/1.1439262
Surface‐Wave Dispersion Applied To The Detection Of Sedimentary Basins,"Seismic surface‐wave velocities are greatly affected by crustal structure. Because there is a strong contrast in the physical properties of clastic sediments and underlying basement materials, surface‐wave dispersion provides a fast, convenient, and inexpensive means of detecting sedimentary basins and estimating their thickness. Model calculations and published reports of explosion studies indicate that sedimentary thicknesses as shallow as 500 m (∼1650 ft) should be detectable by analysis of routinely recorded earthquake seismograms. This study demonstrates the use of seismic surface‐wave dispersion to detect sedimentary basins and to estimate their thickness. The technique is used first for the Mississippi embayment region of the U.S. Gulf Coast, where the crustal structure is known and the results can be verified, and then applied to offshore Greenland, where the crustal structure is unmapped but a sedimentary basin is suspected. The data used are available seismograms of natural earthquakes and, for the Gulf Coast area, an underground nuclear explosion. Because this technique requires only existing, readily available data and may be applied to many regions of the world, it offers an attractive reconnaissance tool in petroleum exploration. In the present study, surface‐wave dispersion and the effects of shallow crustal structure are reviewed in light of this application, and the advantages and limitations of the technique are explored.",10.1190/1.1440514
"Three Dimensional Interpretation Of Gravitational Anomalies, Part Ii","This is the second of two papers describing a method of interpreting residual gravitational anomalies in terms of three‐dimensional geological structures. This paper describes an analytical method for smoothing the data, and for constructing charts and templates for computing derivatives and other quantities required in the interpretation formulae already given in Part I. Tables of all quantities required for the practical utilization of this procedure are provided. Two examples of the application of these methods are given: the first, an artificial problem, and the second, an actual survey conducted over a sulphide body that has been outlined by extensive drilling.",10.1190/1.1437807
Characterization Of Geological Boundaries Using 1‐D Wavelet Transform On Gravity Data: Theory And Application To The Himalayas,"We investigate the use of the continuous wavelet transform for gravity inversion. The wavelet transform operator has recently been introduced in the domain of potential fields both as a filtering and a source‐analysis tool. Here we develop an inverse scheme in the wavelet domain, designed to recover the geometric characteristics of density heterogeneities described by simple‐shaped sources. The 1‐D analyzing wavelet we use associates the upward continuation operator and linear combinations of derivatives of any order. In the gravity case, we first demonstrate how to localize causative sources using simple geometric constructions. Both the upper part of the source and the whole source can be studied when considering low or high altitudes, respectively. The homogeneity degree of the source is deduced without prior information and allows us to infer its shape. Introducing complex wavelets, we derive analytically the scaling behavior of the wavelet coefficients for the dyke and the step sources. The modulus term is used in an inversion procedure to recover the thickness of the source. The phase term provides its dip. This analysis is performed on gravity data we measured along a profile across the Himalayas in Nepal. Good agreement of our results with well‐documented thrusting structures demonstrates the applicability of the method to real data. Also, deeper, less constrained structures are characterized.",10.1190/1.1487060
Borehole Seismic Profiles In The Ekofisk Field,"In October 1983 a major borehole seismic survey was carried out in the Ekofisk oil field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea on behalf of the Phillips Petroleum Licence 018 group of companies. A vertical seismic profile with the source vertically above the geophone in the highly deviated wellbore and three multilevel walk‐away borehole profiles were acquired in an area showing very poor surface seismic returns owing to gas charging in the overlying sediments. The processing of the data through to a series of conventional common‐midpoint sections has permitted detailed interpretation of the top of the Ekofisk formation and the top of the Tor formation apart from well control. Both formations are producers separated by a tight zone. The Tor formation is the primary horizon to waterflood. Information as to its lateral continuity is important in the location of proposed waterflood injector wells. Prior to the survey, the field was considered effectively unfaulted. An apparent graben lying subparallel to the borehole was detected by the surveys. Reflections from below the reservoir formations are evident. A byproduct of the survey is strong evidence for the existence of lateral velocity gradients or apparent transverse velocity isotropy associated with the overlying gas‐charged sediments. Subsequent to the oral presentation of this paper, the graben was drilled and found to have a 41 m fault throw, in its western flank.",10.1190/1.1442246
"Modeling 3D Porosity And Permeability From Gpr Data In The Ellenburger Dolomite, Central Texas"," Three-dimensional porosity and permeability were modeled in an Ellenburger carbonate reservoir analog from 2D crosshole and 3D surface survey ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. Two-dimensional GPR crosshole velocity tomography, 3D migration of the GPR surface data, and porosity and permeability calibration to GPR attributes results in 3D porosity and permeability predictions that provide a consistent model of the paleocave structures and facies distributions. Picking the maximum instantaneous amplitude of the direct arrival wavelet for velocity tomography reduces uncertainties caused by a low signal-to-noise ratio, uncorrelated noise, and the interference between reflections and critical refractions at the earth/air interface. The GPR velocity is anisotropic with an average vertical to horizontal velocity ratio of 0.93, which is attributed to the dominance of the relatively horizontal orientation of the maximum porosity and permeability. Porosity and permeability trends are influenced by regional northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast striking conjugate fractures associated with the Pennsylvanian Ouachita orogeny and breccia facies generated by three episodes of burial and the resulting paleocave collapses. At depths 5.0  m from the present surface, large brecciated dolomite and limestone blocks have low porosity and low permeability. Between a depth of ∼5.0 and ∼9.0  m, irregular fracture orientations and distributions associated with collapse breccias have a higher average porosity and permeability. A deeper zone (∼9.0   to ∼15.0  m in depth), has intermediate permeability and porosity. Porosity and permeability could not be calibrated in open voids. Thus, the predictions are applicable to the core-scale to which they were calibrated, but are lower bounds for the whole volume, which contains breccias, karst, and fractures that increase both porosity and permeability at larger scales.",10.1190/geo2011-0051.1
Statistical Automatic Statics Analysis,"From theoretical considerations and extensive experience, we show that proper weathering statics can be computed by use of a systematic analysis of correlation statistics. Time jitter on individual traces due to weathering variations, variations in shot depth, and trace reversals can be determined and corrected for in the presence of interference due to noise, dip, and improper normal‐moveout corrections. Four independent sets of statistics, requiring two time windows for shot‐oriented data and two time windows for receiver‐oriented data, are used to determine static corrections at the shot and at the receiver. To determine shot statics, we correlate pairs of traces from the same receivers and consecutive shots. Pairs of traces from consecutive receivers and the same shots are correlated to determine receiver statics. These two sets of correlation functions are viewed statistically to determine the two subsets of functions needed for the ensuing analysis. The functions remaining after rejection of those deviating greatly from the average values are summed in groups by receiver and by shot order. The resultant peaks yield two sets of differential statics. A cumulative total of the differential statics is computed. Subtraction of the low wavenumber part of the cumulative total, which is the dip, from the cumulative total yields residual shot and receiver weathering statics.",10.1190/1.1440116
Stacking-Velocity Inversion With Borehole Constraints For Tilted Ti Media,"Transversely isotropic models with a tilted symmetry axis (TTI) play an increasingly important role in seismic imaging, especially near salt bodies and in active tectonic areas. Here, we present a 2D parameter-estimation methodology for TTI media based on combining P-wave normal-moveout (NMO) velocities, zero-offset traveltimes, and reflection time slopes with borehole data that include check-shot traveltimes as well as the reflector depths and dips. For a dipping TTI layer with the symmetry axis confined to the dip plane of the reflector, simultaneous estimation of the symmetry-direction velocity    VP0   , the anisotropy parameters  ϵ  and  δ , and the tilt  ν  of the symmetry axis proves to be ambiguous despite the borehole constraints. If the symmetry axis is orthogonal to the reflector,  VP0  and  δ  can be recovered with high accuracy, even when the symmetry axis deviates by   ±5°   from the reflector normal. The parameter  ϵ , however, cannot be constrained for dips smaller than 60° without using nonhyperbolic moveout. To invert for the interval parameters of layered TTI media, we apply 2D stacking-velocity inversion supplemented with the same borehole constraints. The dip planes in all layers are assumed to be aligned, and the symmetry axis is set orthogonal to the reflector in each layer. Information about reflector dips can be replaced with near-offset walkaway vertical seismic profiling (VSP) traveltimes. Tests on noise-contaminated data demonstrate that the algorithm produces stable estimates of the interval parameters  VP0  and  δ , if the range of dips does not exceed 30°. Our method can be used to build an accurate initial TTI model for post-migration reflection tomography and other techniques that employ migration velocity analysis.",10.1190/1.3481652
Semiautomated Georadar Data Acquisition In Three Dimensions,"Under favorable conditions, georadar techniques can provide vivid images of the shallow subsurface (10–50 m). Although the significant advantages of 3-D georadar surveying strategies are well documented, they generally require much greater expenditures than traditional 2-D approaches. We introduce an efficient, semiautomated 3-D georadar acquisition and processing scheme that does not jeopardize data quality. A standard georadar acquisition unit is integrated with an innovative self‐tracking laser theodolite with automatic target recognition capabilities. Georadar and coordinate data are recorded simultaneously as the georadar antennae are transported steadily across a survey area. While tracking a target prism mounted between the antennae, the theodolite provides real‐time coordinate information with high accuracy in all directions. At ∼1 m/s (moderate walking speed) the coordinates are determined to better than ±0.04 m, and at ∼3 m/s they are better than ±0.07 m. Subsequent to acquisition, semiautomatic processing allows the georadar data to be static corrected, transferred to a regular grid using a novel 2-D Fourier transform method, amplitude modulated, filtered, and displayed. The acquisition component of the new scheme is five to ten times faster than standard step‐mode georadar techniques, and the semiautomatic processing component allows initial 3-D images to be viewed in the field. Typically, a 3-D georadar data set covering a 25 m × 25 m area may be collected and processed in less than 3 hours. One such data set recorded across a former glaciofluvial environment allows reflections from complex river channel sediments and surface features to be readily identified and interpreted.",10.1190/1.1444581
On The Instability In Second-Order Systems For Acoustic Vti And Tti Media,"We studied second-order wave propagation systems for vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) and tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) acoustic media with variable axes of symmetry that have their shear-wave speeds set to zero. Acoustic TTI systems are commonly used in reverse-time migration, but these second-order systems are susceptible to instablities appearing as nonphysical stationary noise growing linearly in time, particularly in variable-tilt TTI media. We found an explanation of the cause of this phenomenon. The instabilities are not caused only by the numerical schemes; they are inherent to the differential equations. These instabilities are present even in homogeneous VTI media. These instabilities are caused by zero wave speeds at a wide variety of wavenumbers — a direct consequence of setting the shear-wave speeds to zero — coupled with the second time derivative in these systems. Although the second-order isotropic wave equation allows smooth time-growing solutions, a larger class of time-growing solutions exists for the second-order acoustic TI systems, including nonsmooth solutions. Boundary conditions appear to be less effective in controlling these time-growing solutions than they are for the isotropic wave equation. These systems conserve an incomplete energy that does not prevent the instabilities. The corresponding steady-state systems are no longer elliptic differential equations and can have nonsmooth solutions that are related to the instabilities. We started initially with homogeneous VTI media, and then extended these results to heterogeneous variable-tilt TTI media. We also developed a second-order acoustic system for heterogeneous variable-tilt TTI media derived directly from the full-elastic system for heterogeneous variable-tilt TTI media. All second-order systems with a dispersion relation obtained by setting the shear-wave speeds to zero in the elastic dispersion relation allowed these nonphysical time-growing solutions; however, knowing the cause of these instabilities, it may be possible to prevent or control the activation of these solutions.",10.1190/geo2011-0250.1
Remote Monitoring Of The Steam‐Flood Enhanced Oil Recovery Process,Cross‐borehole seismic velocity and high‐frequency electromagnetic (EM) attenuation data were obtained to construct tomographic images of heavy oil sands in a steam‐flood environment. First‐arrival seismic data were used to construct a tomographic color image of a 10 m by 8 m vertical plane between the two boreholes. Two high‐frequency (17 and 15 MHz) EM transmission tomographs were constructed of a 20 m by 8 m vertical plane. The velocity tomograph clearly shows a shale layer with oil sands above it and below it. The EM tomographs show a more complex geology of oil sands with shale inclusions. The deepest EM tomograph shows the upper part of an active steam zone and suggests steam chanelling just below the shale layer. These results show the detailed structure of the entire plane between boreholes and may provide a better means to understand the process for in situ heavy oil recovery in a steam‐flood environment.,10.1190/1.1442263
Duties Of A Logging Co‐Ordinator In An Operating Company,"A well logging co‐ordinator for an operating oil company is often considered to be only a ""log analyst"" but quantitative log analysis should constitute only a small part of his duties. Associated with the actual analysis are the compilation and preparation of auxiliary reservoir data, field research and evaluation of new tools and methods designed to solve problems of particular areas and conditions, the co‐ordination of logging programs with drilling programs and the development of interpretation techniques. For the company to achieve the most efficient use of its logging dollar, the co‐ordinator must maintain a constant check on log quality, conduct schools on formation evaluation for field personnel and serve as an advisor on unitization committees. It is helpful to him in realizing this program to have a logging research group within the overall research effort of the operating company to aid him in specific problems and to help him keep abreast of industry‐wide research.",10.1190/1.1438759
Offset‐Dependent Geometrical Spreading In A Layered Medium,"The geometrical spreading for a point source in a horizontally layered medium has been computed by Ursin (1978) and Hubral (1978) as a Taylor series in the offset coordinate. The coefficients in the Taylor series depend on the thicknesses and the velocities of the layers. Here, I start with the exact expression for geometrical spreading and show that it can be expressed as a function of the velocity in the first layer, the offset, and the first‐ and second‐order traveltime derivatives. A shifted hyperbolic traveltime approximation (Castle, 1988) and the usual hyperbolic traveltime approximation are used to derive approximate expressions for geometrical spreading. These expressions can also be derived from a truncated Taylor series by making additional approximations, but this procedure is not so obvious.",10.1190/1.1442860
"Time‐Domain Magnetization Of Soils (Vrm), Experimental Relationship To Quadrature Susceptibility","A comparison is made between measurements with a multichannel bipolar pulsed‐induction meter (PIM) and measurements made with a phase‐sensitive susceptibility bridge on more than 211 soil samples from a variety of archaeological sites in Europe. Eddy currents originating from the decay of viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) were measured with the PIM. The in‐phase and out‐of‐phase (κq) magnetic mass susceptibilies were measured with the susceptibility bridge. Viscous remanent magnetization was measured through eight time sampling intervals on the pulsed‐induction meter, and the linearity of VRM for selected samples was tested at various field strengths (200 to 2300 μT). It is believed that this extension of the reversible range indicates a high coercive strength of the magnetic grains in the soil samples involved. Whatever the origin of the soil sample, a constant decay of VRM with time was observed between 56 and 417 μs, after switching off the inducing field. This relation is shown to be a power law with exponent −1.4. This roughly agrees with a theoretical model that takes into account a finite‐energizing time of the transmitter pulse and single‐domain (SD) behavior of particles. Finally, a comparison is made between VRM and quadrature susceptibility (κq). This comparison is in accordance with well dispersed single‐domain theory, and was found to be a linear relationship.",10.1190/1.1443416
Normal Moveout Revisited: Inhomogeneous Media And Curved Interfaces,"The equation of normal moveout, t2=t02+x2/Va2, is valid for a reflection from the base of a single homogeneous and isotropic bed, but is only an approximation in the real world of multilayered, inhomogeneous media and curved interfaces. Using the theory of geometrical optics, we can find another second‐order equation which represents hyperbolas that are also symmetrical about the time axis. However, the centers of these hyperbolas do not coincide with the center of coordinates, but are shifted along the time axis. The equation describing this second type of hyperbola is (t+tp-t0)2=tp2+x2/V12, where tp is the time of focusing depth and V1, the velocity of the input medium. This equation is not only more accurate than the usual normal moveout, but its use is more economical on a vector computer because the traditional dynamic correction is a static correction in the tp analysis. This procedure makes it possible to compute velocities for all the samples of all the stacked traces and produces a velocity section. tp analysis can also be used to build a stacked section without any manual picking of velocities. The same concepts can be extended to the section after stack, allowing recognition of the geometrical patterns of the reflectors.",10.1190/1.1442449
Geophysical Research And Progress In Exploration,"This paper, the SEG Research Committee's second annual review of current developments in exploration geophysics, will emphasize research activities at universities and other non‐commercial institutions which relate closely to geophysical exploration. Industry developments worth noting in the seismic field include the considerable increase in use of magnetic recording, use of pressure‐sensitive geophones with preamplifiers in the bay and marsh areas of the Gulf Coast, use of fathometer‐type instruments to obtain near bottom layering in marine areas, and use of nonphotographic methods of reproducing seismic data. Considerable experimentation with weight dropping techniques, and with use of higher frequencies to get better resolution has continued during the past year. Use of models, particularly two dimensional models, is increasing. There have been significant innovations in logging techniques, particularly in the use of in‐hole accelerators for neutron generation, and in the development of in‐hole equipment for measuring gamma ray spectra. The use of continuous velocity logs is increasing. Academic research has been of two kinds. First, there are studies of basic physical principles underlying current or prospective exploration methods which could lead to improvements and new applications. Secondly, geophysical methods originally developed for petroleum exploration are being employed for large‐scale investigations of the earth's crustal structure. These studies should contribute important information on the geology of such features as continental shelves, geosynclines, and mountain systems, information potentially useful to geologists for developing new concepts in exploration thinking. The two kinds of research illustrate the current interdependence between ""pure"" and ""applied"" geophysics. Important research projects on scattering, statistical improvement of signal‐to‐noise, explosionwave generation in the earth, and surface waves exemplify the activity going on in university laboratories today which may result in improved seismic exploration techniques tomorrow. Conversely, university‐sponsored seismic and gravity investigations of the deep oceans, the continental margins and various western mountain chains illustrate how geophysics is contributing basic geologic information on a regional to global scale.",10.1190/1.1438374
Bayesian Inversion Of Pressure Diffusivity From Microseismicity,"We have considered the problem of using microseismic data to characterize the flow of injected fluid during hydraulic fracturing. We have developed a simple probabilistic physical model that directly ties the fluid pressure in the subsurface during the injection to observations of induced microseismicity. This tractable model includes key physical parameters that affect fluid pressure, rock failure, and seismic wave propagation. It is also amenable to a rigorous uncertainty quantification analysis of the forward model and the inversion. We have used this probabilistic rock failure model to invert for fluid pressure during injection from synthetically generated microseismicity and to quantify the uncertainty of this inversion. The results of our analysis can be used to assess the effectiveness of microseismic monitoring in a given experiment and even to suggest ways to improve the quality and value of monitoring.",10.1190/geo2014-0374.1
Seismic Monitoring Of Water Floods?—A Petrophysical Study,"Seismic velocities were measured in the laboratory on 67 samples as a function of pressure and temperature when saturated with gas and a 35° API = 141.5/(density at 1 atmosphere and 60°F) − 131.5] mineral oil and flooded with pentane and fresh water, respectively, using an ultrasonic pulse transmission method. The rock samples consisted of 39 carbonate cores from eight reservoirs, 22 sandstone cores from six formations, and six unconsolidated samples from three origins. The results show that water flooding increases the compressional velocity Vp by more than 5 percent in most of the gas‐saturated cores at effective pressures (overburden pressure minus pore pressure) less than 20 MPa. Such Vp increase is less than 5 percent in about half of the carbonate cores and some of the sandstone cores with normal pentane and in all the consolidated cores (both carbonates and sandstones) saturated with the 35° API oil. However, in unconsolidated samples saturated with gas, pentane, or oil, water flooding increases the Vp substantially. Both the laboratory results and theoretical analysis show that seismic methods may succeed in monitoring water floods in some reservoirs under certain conditions, while they may fail in others. It is thus important to carry out petrophysical and feasibility studies prior to the implementation of in‐situ seismic monitoring of water‐flood processes.",10.1190/1.1442972
General Representations For Wavefield Modeling And Inversion In Geophysics,"Acoustic, electromagnetic, elastodynamic, poroelastic, and electroseismic waves are all governed by a unified matrix-vector wave equation. The matrices in this equation obey the same symmetry properties for each of these wave phenomena. This implies that the wave vectors for each of these phenomena obey the same reciprocity theorems. By substituting Green's matrices in these reciprocity theorems, unified wavefield representations are obtained. Analogous to the well-known acoustic wavefield representations, these unified representations find applications in geophysical modeling, migration, inversion, multiple elimination, and interferometry.",10.1190/1.2750646
Estimation Of Near‐Surface Shear‐Wave Velocity By Inversion Of Rayleigh Waves,"The shear‐wave (S-wave) velocity of near‐surface materials (soil, rocks, pavement) and its effect on seismic‐wave propagation are of fundamental interest in many groundwater, engineering, and environmental studies. Rayleigh‐wave phase velocity of a layered‐earth model is a function of frequency and four groups of earth properties: P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, density, and thickness of layers. Analysis of the Jacobian matrix provides a measure of dispersion‐curve sensitivity to earth properties. S-wave velocities are the dominant influence on a dispersion curve in a high‐frequency range (5 Hz) followed by layer thickness. An iterative solution technique to the weighted equation proved very effective in the high‐frequency range when using the Levenberg‐Marquardt and singular‐value decomposition techniques. Convergence of the weighted solution is guaranteed through selection of the damping factor using the Levenberg‐Marquardt method. Synthetic examples demonstrated calculation efficiency and stability of inverse procedures. We verify our method using borehole S-wave velocity measurements.",10.1190/1.1444578
Imaging Structures Below Dipping Ti Media,Seismic anisotropy in dipping shales causes imaging and positioning problems for underlying structures. We developed an anisotropic depth‐migration approach for P-wave seismic data in transversely isotropic (TI) media with a tilted axis of symmetry normal to bedding. We added anisotropic and dip parameters to the depth‐imaging velocity model and used prestack depth‐migrated image gathers in a diagnostic manner to refine the anisotropic velocity model. The apparent position of structures below dipping anisotropic overburden changes considerably between isotropic and anisotropic migrations. The ray‐tracing algorithm used in a 2-D prestack Kirchhoff depth migration was modified to calculate traveltimes in the presence of TI media with a tilted symmetry axis. The resulting anisotropic depth‐migration algorithm was applied to physical‐model seismic data and field seismic data from the Canadian Rocky Mountain Thrust and Fold Belt. The anisotropic depth migrations offer significant improvements in positioning and reflector continuity over those obtained using isotropic algorithms.,10.1190/1.1444630
Calculation Of Magnitude Magnetic Transforms With High Centricity And Low Dependence On The Magnetization Vector Direction,"The Matlab tool is designed to deal with big data sets and is compatible with common data formats, GS ASCII grid files, and XYZ data files. A calculation of the MMTs of the total magnetic anomaly of a synthetic example at a low magnetic latitude and with a field example from the Kuju volcanic area, Japan demonstrate the effectiveness of the program.",10.1190/1.2335516
Enhancements To Prestack Frequency‐Wavenumber (F-K) Migration,"Prestack frequency‐wavenumber (f-k) migration is a particularly efficient method of doing both full prestack time migration and migration velocity analysis. Conventional implementations of the method, however, can encounter several drawbacks: (1) poor resolution and spatial aliasing noise caused by insufficient sampling in the offset dimension, (2) poor definition of steep events caused by insufficient sampling in the velocity dimension, and (3) inadequate handling of ray bending for steep events. All three of these problems can be mitigated with modifications to the prestack f-k algorithm. The application of linear moveout (LMO) in the offset dimension prior to migration reduces event moveout and hence increases the bandwidth of non‐spatially aliased signals. To reduce problems of interpolation for steep events, the number of constant‐velocity migrations can be economically increased by performing residual poststack migrations. Finally, migration with a dip‐dependent imaging velocity addresses the issue of ray bending and thereby improves the positioning of steep events. None of these enhancements substantially increases the computational effort of f-k migration. Prestack f-k migration possesses a limitation for which no solution is readily available. Where lateral velocity variation is modest, steep events (such as fault‐plane reflections in sediments) may not be imaged as well as by other migration approaches. This shortcoming results from the restriction that, in the prestack f-k approach, a single velocity field must serve to perform two different functions: imaging and stacking. Nevertheless, in areas of strong velocity variation and gentle to moderate dip, the detailed velocity control afforded by the prestack f-k method is an excellent source of geologic information.",10.1190/1.1442955
Fresnel Zones In The Light Of Broadband Data,"The investigation of zero‐offset response to circular reflectors of increasing Fresnel zone size shows that reflection response is a constant and is independent of reflector size, except when the reflector diameter is so small that the diffractions interfere with the primary reflection. The extent of this effect is dependent upon vertical resolution and the time separation of the primary reflector and the diffraction. Interference occurs for reflectors smaller in diameter than the first Fresnel zone. Migration removes this interference. For broadband data the Fresnel zone solution breaks into two parts: the primary reflector and the edge‐effects diffractor. With broadband seismic data, reflections and diffractions separate in time, except at locations near faults or very small bodies. Reflections are the seismic response to interlayer discontinuity and are independent of reflector size. Diffractions are the seismic response to lateral discontinuities and edges and depend on proximity to—and geometry of—the edge. Except in the locale of an edge, broadband reflections and diffractions are separated physically on the section and mentally by the interpreter. Furthermore, standard CMP processing attenuates diffractions, especially when CMP lateral offset is some distance from the diffractor.",10.1190/1.1443049
Dual Tomography For Imaging Complex Structures,"The geophysical community admits that geotomography is a workable way to obtain accurate estimates of seismic velocity in complex structures. So‐called dual tomography improves the resolution of computed tomograms and thus can be applied to different geophysical and nongeophysical problems. Dual tomography emerges as a generalized approach to linearized constrained inversion. Dual inversion transforms a generalized constrained optimization problem being formulated in the physical space of seismic velocities to a dual unconstrained problem posed in the vector space of Lagrangian multipliers. It is a parametric optimization problem, with unknown solutions that are always perpendicular to the null‐space of a tomographic matrix. Imposed constraints improve the resolution and act as if the angular aperture coverage was extended. Thus dual tomography is able to quash image blurring associated with incomplete angular recording. Dual tomography does not require accurate knowledge of initial model. One starts with an arbitrary homogeneous medium and updates the medium in the course of iterations. Dual tomography does not require direct inversion of matrices and therefore it is relatively fast. Preliminary results indicate that dual tomography typically yields better images compared with algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), simultaneous reconstruction technique (SIRT), and other conventional techniques especially for limited angular aperture experiments typically used in seismic exploration.",10.1190/1.1443159
Structural Interpretation Using Refraction Velocities From Marine Seismic Surveys,"Subsurface structure can be mapped using refraction information from marine multichannel seismic data. The method uses velocities and thicknesses of shallow sedimentary rock layers computed from refraction first arrivals recorded along the streamer. A two‐step exploration scheme is described which can be set up on a personal computer and used routinely in any office. It is straightforward and requires only a basic understanding of refraction principles. Two case histories from offshore Peru exploration demonstrate the scheme. The basic scheme is: step (1) shallow sedimentary rock velocities are computed and mapped over an area. Step (2) structure is interpreted from the contoured velocity patterns. Structural highs, for instance, exhibit relatively high velocities, ""retained"" by buried, compacted, sedimentary rocks that are uplifted to the near‐surface. This method requires that subsurface structure be relatively shallow because the refracted waves probe to depths of one hundred to over one thousand meters, depending upon the seismic energy source, streamer length, and the subsurface velocity distribution. With this one requirement met, we used the refraction method over a wide range of sedimentary rock velocities, water depths, and seismic survey types. The method is particularly valuable because it works well in areas with poor seismic reflection data.",10.1190/1.1442026
The Magnetotelluric Transverse Electric Mode As A Natural Filter For Static Effects: Application To The Coprod2 And Coprod2S2 Data Sets,"We regard the amplitude of the magnetotelluric impedance of the transverse electric (TE) mode as output, rather than input, in 2D inverse algorithms. The model obtained in the inversion is in this context only an intermediate product whose TE theoretical response is for all intents and purposes the object of the inversion. The input is the amplitude of the transverse magnetic (TM) mode and the phases of both modes. They are fitted as much as possible by relaxing regularization to its limits, allowing the model to include features not strictly required by the data, but still required by the amplitude of the TE curves. We propose two tests to guaranty the accuracy and reliability of the recovery. The first is a convergence test whereby the output is monitored as a function of the roughness of the model. Second, the TM amplitude data are multiplied by different factors and the output is checked for consistency with the previous test. The resulting TE responses have only electromagnetic induction effects and thus are free from static shifts due to electric charges. We apply the procedure to the synthetic COPROD2S2 data set and compute static factors for TE and TM modes. We propose an image based on depth averages of conductivity along with a nonlinear resolution-variance analysis of the image as the final interpretation of the data. The procedure is also applied to the well-known COPROD2 field data set.",10.1190/geo2012-0522.1
Structure-Coupled Joint Inversion Of Geophysical And Hydrological Data,"In groundwater hydrology, geophysical imaging holds considerable promise for improving parameter estimation, due to the generally high resolution and spatial coverage of geophysical data. However, inversion of geophysical data alone cannot unveil the distribution of hydraulic conductivity. Jointly inverting geophysical and hydrological data allows us to benefit from the advantages of geophysical imaging and, at the same time, recover the hydrological parameters of interest. We have applied a coupling strategy between geophysical and hydrological models that is based on structural similarity constraints. Model combinations, for which the spatial gradients of the inferred parameter fields are not aligned in parallel, are penalized in the inversion. This structural coupling does not require introducing a potentially weak, unknown, and nonstationary petrophysical relation to link the models. The method was first tested on synthetic data sets and then applied to two combinations of geophysical/hydrological data sets from a saturated gravel aquifer in northern Switzerland. Crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) traveltimes were jointly inverted with hydraulic tomography data, as well as with tracer mean arrival times, to retrieve the 2D distribution of GPR velocities and hydraulic conductivities. In the synthetic case, incorporating the GPR data through a joint inversion framework improved the resolution and localization properties of the estimated hydraulic conductivity field. For the field study, recovered hydraulic conductivities were in general agreement with flowmeter data.",10.1190/geo2012-0460.1
Results And Limitations Of Magnetotelluric Surveys In Simple Geologic Situations,"Results are presented of magnetotelluric measurements near a fault and on deep horizontal sediments. These are compared with known geological and geophysical data from the same localities, and are found to be in fair agreement with predictions from existing theories. Differences are attributed to shortcomings in measurement and analysis techniques, to geological complications, and partly to possible failings in the Cagniard and d'Erceville‐Kunetz theories. Evidence is discussed indicating substantial variation of Upper‐Mantle conductivity with location.",10.1190/1.1439272
Inversion Of The Power Spectrum From Gravity Anomalies Of Prismatic Bodies,"I develop methods for modeling and inversion of gravity anomalies produced by prismatic bodies. The forward problem is solved in the wavenumber domain, where the power spectrum of the gravity anomaly is given by the product of independent functions that describe depth, thickness, horizontal dimensions, and density of the source body. The solution of the inverse problem is based on an iterative ridge‐regression algorithm, starting from an initial trial of the geometry and density of the source body. This procedure is assessed in a number of examples with both numeric and field data spectra. The method is first tested on the spectrum obtained from simple gravity anomalies and is found to be capable of recovering the source parameters. Next the method is applied to gravity data from a survey made near Noranda, Quebec, Canada. This interpretation compares favorably with drillhole data and provides an estimation of the mass of the source body which is similar to previous estimates.",10.1190/1.1443902
Using Downward Continuation To Reduce Memory Requirements In Reverse‐Time Migration,"In conventional reverse‐time depth migration, successive time slices from a stacked seismic section are inserted as boundary values at the top of the image space, and the wavefield is extrapolated backward in time until time = 0. The resulting fixed‐time snapshot of the propagating wavefield, in space, is the migrate d image.",10.1190/1.1443298
Viscosity In Air-Gun Bubble Modeling,"I have presented finite volume simulations of an air-gun bubble in which the compressible Navier-Stokes equations were solved numerically. These equations included viscosity. My simulation also applied the no-slip condition at the bubble surface. The effects of the viscous terms were small; however, the effect of the no-slip condition was significant, causing a reduction in the bubble rise rate of 18.1% and an increase in the collapse pressure of 17.9%. The no-slip condition caused boundary layers at the bubble surface and changes in the velocity structure throughout the bubble. The no-slip condition allowed the effect of skin-friction drag on the bubble to be captured, along with Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the surface, which caused a change in the shape of the bubble during collapse. The influence of the no-slip condition suggests that it is important and should be included in air-gun bubble models.",10.1190/geo2015-0199.1
A Line‐Integral Method Of Computing The Gravimetric Effects Of Two‐Dimensional Masses,"Many computing schemes have been devised for determining the gravity anomalies produced by two‐dimensional masses. Most of these are based upon the evaluation of an areal integral and require specially constructed templates or tables. In the present paper it is shown that the gravity anomaly Δg at the origin of coordinates, produced by a two‐dimensional mass of constant density contrast Δρ, may be obtained quite simply by means of either of the line integrals ",10.1190/1.1437395
Inversion-Based Petrophysical Interpretation Of Logging-While-Drilling Nuclear And Resistivity Measurements,"Interpretation of borehole measurements acquired in high-angle (HA) and horizontal (HZ) wells is challenging due to the significant influence of well trajectory and bed geometrical effects. Experience shows that accurate integrated interpretation of well logs acquired in HA/HZ wells requires explicit consideration of 3D measurement physics. The most reliable alternative for interpretation of well logs in HA/HZ wells is with inversion techniques that correct measurements for shoulder-bed, undulating well trajectory, and bed geometrical effects while taking advantage of high data resolution. We discovered an efficient layer-based inversion workflow for combined, quantitative petrophysical and compositional interpretation of logging-while-drilling sector-based nuclear (density, neutron porosity, photoelectric factor, gamma ray) and array propagation resistivity measurements acquired in HA/HZ wells. A challenging synthetic benchmark example confirmed improved formation evaluation with the layer-based inversion workflow across hydrocarbon-bearing zones in HA/HZ wells, where estimated hydrocarbon pore volume and porosity increased by 10% and 15%, respectively, with respect to conventional interpretation methods. Furthermore, application of the inversion-based method to a field example of HZ well across calcite-cemented siltstone layers confirmed its advantage over conventional interpretation techniques.",10.1190/geo2013-0175.1
Suggestions Of A New Method Of Making Underground Observations,"In the north‐central part of the State of Texas, where wells are being drilled to the depth of 4,000 feet and more in order to penetrate the Bend formation (Pennsylvanian), which is the chief oil‐bearing horizon in that part of the State, it has been found that the structure of the Bend and that of the underlying Ellenburger limestone (Ordovician) is quite generally the same. The plotting of underground structure by drillers' logs or by observations on cuttings from the Bend is very difficult, for the reason that there are small variations in the rocks of the Bend, not only vertically but also horizontally, and that these small variations lie near the limit between shale and limestone. Whether a certain part of the formation is reported as shale or as limestone will in large part depend upon the judgment and experience of the driller, or other observer. It has been exceedingly difficult to trace a definite horizon in the Bend with any considerable certainty. Exposures of the Bend indicate also that there are horizontal changes in this formation. For those who use drillers' logs in the making of structural maps, it has been found expedient to use the contact of the Bend and the underlying Ellenburger as the key horizon. Contours are drawn on the upper surface of the Ellenburger.",10.1190/1.1437724
Electromagnetic Field Of A Dipole On A Two‐Layer Earth,"The electromagnetic field due to a horizontal electric dipole placed on top of a two‐layer earth is represented in terms of fields due to a dipole over a half‐space earth and its image source fields. Integral representations of image source fields are evaluated with uniform asymptotic approximations. Leading order ordinary saddle‐point approximation, giving rise to the geometrical optics approximation (GOA), is shown to be inaccurate. This is especially true when the angle of observation is close to the critical angle, which corresponds to the presence of a branch‐point singularity near the saddle point. In the uniform asymptotic approximation, the integrand of the image source integral is split into a branch‐point free part and another part containing the branch‐point singularity. The branch‐point free part can be approximated with a spherical wave function, while the part containing the branch point can be approximated with parabolic cylinder functions. Vertical magnetic field components and the horizontal electric field component near the surface are illustrated and compared with the geometrical optics approximation, giving the direct numerical result as well as experimental measurement. It is shown that the uniform asymptotic approximation yields excellent agreement with numerical and experimental results compared to the geometrical optics approximation.",10.1190/1.1441201
Relation Of Seismic Corrections To Surface Geology,"The arbitrary application of any set type of near‐surface corrections to seismic data can lead to erroneous results. The determination of the type of correction to be used must be based, in part, on the type of formations present in the near‐surface. Case studies are offered to illustrate conditions arising in areas of youthful and mature topography. Specifically, they deal with a complex low velocity layer problem in a river valley, a pre‐glacial topography in the Illinois Basin, a problem arising in a mature topography in Kansas, and a youthful topography in central Wyoming. In such cases, the use of a ""floating"" elevation reference plane is advocated for the ""Correction Zone"" lying immediately below the surface.",10.1190/1.1437747
Breakthrough Acquisition And Technologies For Subsalt Imaging,"The recently introduced method of wide-azimuth data acquisition offers better illumination, noise attenuation, and lower frequencies to more accurately determine a velocity field for imaging. For the field data experiment to demonstrate the technologies, we used a Gulf of Mexico (GOM) wide-azimuth data set that allows us to take advantage of possible low frequencies, relatively large crossline offsets, and increased illumination. The input data was processed through true 3D azimuthal surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) with zero-phasing and debubble. Eliminating the surface-related multiples aids the velocity determination and helps uncover the subsalt sediments at the final imaging stage. After the initial velocity derivation, which was constrained to wells and geology, full-waveform inversion (FWI) was used to further update the velocity field to achieve an enhanced image. The methodology used follows the top-down approach where suprasalt sediment model is developed followed by the top of salt, salt flanks, base of salt, and finished with a limited subsalt update. To approximate the observed data by using an acoustic inversion procedure, the propagator includes effects of attenuation, anisotropy, acquisition source, and receiver depth. The geological environment is salt related, which implies that the observed data is highly elastic, even though it is input to an acoustic full waveform inversion. To use the proper constraints for the inversion, layer-stripping method is used to develop the high-resolution velocity field. The inversion stages were carefully quality controlled through gather displays to ensure the kinematics were honored. We then demonstrated the benefit of the FWI velocity field by comparing the images derived with the traditional ray-based tomographic velocity field versus the velocity field derived by FWI performing reverse time migration to produce these images. Finally, the images were compared at key well locations to evaluate the robustness of the workflow.",10.1190/geo2010-0399.1
Stepped Inversion Of Magnetic Data,"We present a three-step magnetic inversion procedure in which invariant quantities with respect to source parameters are inverted sequentially to give (1) shape cross section, (2) magnetization intensity, and (3) magnetization direction for a 2D (elongated) magnetic source. The quantity first inverted (called here the shape function) is obtained from the ratio of the gradient intensity of the total-field anomaly to the intensity of the anomalous vector field. For homogenous sources, the shape function is invariant with source magnetization and allows reconstruction of the source geometry by attributing an arbitrary magnetization to trial solutions. Once determined, the source shape is fixed and magnetization intensity is estimated by fitting the total gradient of the total-field anomaly (equivalent to the amplitude of the analytic signal of magnetic anomaly). Finally, the source shape and magnetization intensity are fixed and the magnetization direction is determined by fitting the magnetic anomaly. As suggested by numerical modeling and real data application, stepped inversion allows checking whether causative sources are homogeneous. This is possible because the shape function from inhomogeneous sources can be fitted by homogeneous models, but a model obtained in this way fits neither the total gradient of the magnetic anomaly nor the magnetic anomaly itself. Such a criterion seems effective in recognizing strongly inhomogeneous sources. Stepped inversion is tested with numerical experiments, and is used to model a magnetic anomaly from intrusive basic rocks from the Paraná Basin, Brazil.",10.1190/1.2711661
Accurate Data Reconstruction Through Simultaneous Application Of Statistical And Physics-Based Constraints To Multiple Geophysical Data Sets,"Insufficient sampling is a key problem that affects seismic data-processing techniques. Although existing interpolation methods can fill in large gaps in the data under certain assumptions, their performance degrades as shot and receiver sampling becomes coarser. Most existing data-interpolation techniques overcome insufficient sampling by making assumptions regarding either the statistical properties of the data or the physics that explain the data. Recognizing that statistical and physics-based constraints can be expressed as convex sets, we propose overcoming some of the deficiencies of existing methods by incorporating multiple types of prior information and equations describing the mapping between different types of data into a mathematically consistent framework based on the projection onto convex sets (POCS) methodology. The proposed method is easy to implement in practice because it relies only upon the iterative application of projection operators (e.g., soft thresholding). At the same time, full advantage of various forms of prior information can be taken. Using a synthetic example of combining conventional streamer and ocean-bottom–cable (OBC) data, we show that our method provides substantial improvement compared to using statistical assumptions alone. Other potential applications include data reconstruction in the case of over-under streamer acquisition, dual-sensor streamer acquisition, multi-azimuth surveys, and vertical seismic profiling.",10.1190/1.3481653
A Resistivity Computation Method For Layered Earth Models,"A procedure is given to compute apparent resistivity and induced‐polarization results for layered earth structures. The method is designed for use with large computers. Results may be obtained for any number of layers, and for any of the commonly used electrode configurations. Specific expressions are given for Schlumberger, Wenner, azimuthal‐dipole, axial‐dipole, and for the potential function. The method consists in expanding a portion of the integrand as a series in e-2Nt and integrating analytically term by term. Convergence of the resulting series is established. The required coefficients for each term in the series can be obtained by recursion formulas from preceding coefficients. Accuracy of the results can be estimated and can be preselected. For the Schlumberger electrode arrangement with spacing L, for example, the error produced by truncating the series after M terms will be no greater than L3/8M2. A more rigid bound on the error is also given. Accuracy of the method was further checked against published apparent resistivity data and against a numerical integration procedure devised for this purpose. The following characteristics make the method well suited for use with digital computers: (1) The formulation is relatively simple and easily programmed. (2) A single program will handle any number of layers. (3) The computer can be made to generate the required coefficients internally. (4) The computer can be programmed to terminate the computation as soon as any preselected accuracy has been achieved. (5) Complete separation is attained between earth structure and electrode arrangement; thus, a single set of stored coefficients can be used repeatedly for different electrode spacings and different electrode arrangements.",10.1190/1.1439733
Matched Filter Detection Of Electromagnetic Transient Reflections,"An electromagnetic transient signal is distorted as it travels in the conducting earth. At vertical incidence, the signal is stretched by a time that is proportional to the magnetic permeability, conductivity, and depth squared. The stretch is a function of the travel distance, and a set of filters can be constructed to match the waveforms of signals which have traveled to different depths. Surface waves travel from the source and can overlap the reflected signals. The reflected signals were estimated by subtracting an estimate of the surface wave and then passing the estimated reflections through a set of matched filters. This method was tested by means of numerical models and laboratory models. The latter were coaxial coils on aluminum plates. In both cases, the matched filters determined the depth of the reflected signals.",10.1190/1.1440457
Quasi‐Shear Waves In Inhomogeneous Weakly Anisotropic Media By The Quasi‐Isotropic Approach: A Model Study,"In inhomogeneous isotropic regions, S-waves can be modeled using the ray method for isotropic media. In inhomogeneous strongly anisotropic regions, the independently propagating qS1- and qS2-waves can similarly be modeled using the ray method for anisotropic media. The latter method does not work properly in inhomogenous weakly anisotropic regions, however, where the split qS-waves couple. The zeroth‐order approximation of the quasi‐isotropic (QI) approach was designed for just such inhomogeneous weakly anisotropic media, for which neither the ray method for isotropic nor anisotropic media applies. We test the ranges of validity of these three methods using two simple synthetic models. Our results show that the QI approach more than spans the gap between the ray methods: it can be used in isotropic regions (where it reduces to the ray method for isotropic media), in regions of weak anisotropy (where the ray method for anisotropic media does not work properly), and even in regions of moderately strong anisotropy (in which the qS-waves decouple and thus could be modeled using the ray method for anisotropic media). A modeling program that switches between these three methods as necessary should be valid for arbitrary‐strength anisotropy.",10.1190/1.1444909
Ground‐Roll Suppression Using The Wavelet Transform,"Low‐frequency, high‐amplitude ground roll is an old problem in land‐based seismic field records. Current processing techniques aimed at ground‐roll suppression, such as frequency filtering, f-k filtering, and f-k filtering with time‐offset windowing, use the Fourier transform, a technique that assumes that the basic seismic signal is stationary. A new alternative to the Fourier transform is the wavelet transform, which decomposes a function using basis functions that, unlike the Fourier transform, have finite extent in both frequency and time. Application of a filter based on the wavelet transform to land seismic shot records suppresses ground roll in a time‐frequency sense; unlike the Fourier filter, this filter does not assume that the signal is stationary. The wavelet transform technique also allows more effective time‐frequency analysis and filtering than current processing techniques and can be implemented using an algorithm as computationally efficient as the fast Fourier transform. This new filtering technique leads to the improvement of shot records and considerably improves the final stack quality.",10.1190/1.1444290
Electromagnetic Induction In An Inhomogeneous Conductive Thin Sheet,"Distinguishing between the electromagnetic (EM) response of a subsurface conductor and the EM response of an overburden whose conductivity and/or thickness varies laterally requires a capability to calculate the EM response of both types of conductor. While methods for calculating the response of some simple subsurface conductors such as dipping rectangular sheets are already available, methods for computing the response of an irregular overburden are not common. Using Price's analysis, we have formulated two numerical techniques for calculating the response of a laterally varying overburden which is thin and flat, and which lies on a perfectly resistive subspace. The first technique is a frequency‐domain method in which a large matrix equation is solved to find the horizontal‐wavenumber components of the secondary vertical magnetic field. The method is best suited to calculating the response of the overburden when the EM source and receiver are located above the sheet, such as in airborne EM systems. Helicopter EM profiles calculated using this technique have been checked against a simple scale model. The second method calculates the time‐domain step response of the overburden by time‐stepping the vertical component of the magnetic field. The method is suitable for calculating the response of the overburden when the EM source is a large transmitter loop close to the overburden. Using the time‐domain method to investigate the response of simple conductance structures illustrates that the zero crossing of the vertical magnetic field moves more slowly across conductive regions than across resistive regions. This is because the rate of decay of the vertical field in a region varies in proportion to the resistance of the region. A response profile from a UTEM survey shows a response that could be interpreted as due to a dipping subsurface conductor. This response has been modeled using the time‐domain method, and a geologically acceptable pattern of lateral variations in the overburden conductance yields a response close to the measured EM response. Thus, a subsurface conductor need not lie below the profile line to explain the response.",10.1190/1.1442284
Thermal Regime Of A Large Diameter Borehole: Instability Of The Water Column And Comparison Of Air‐ And Water‐Filled Conditions,"Temperatures were measured as a function time and depth in a borehole before and after it had been filled with water. The hole is 25 cm in diameter, 340 m deep, and effectively sealed from influx of ground water. The measurements reveal that: (1) Temperature differences between the air‐filled hole and the water‐filled hole (after dissipation of the water injection disturbance) do not exceed 0.05°C at the same depth. (2) Temperatures in the water‐filled hole exhibit oscillations at all depths where temperature increases downward but are stable at the bottom and near the surface where temperature decreases with depth. (3) The temperature oscillations have periods ranging from several minutes to several hours. (4) The amplitudes of the oscillations are several hundredths of a degree, and are roughly proportional to the geothermal gradient near the point of measurement, thus suggesting that the size of cells or eddies are rather constant and that the distance of water movement is no more than several times the inner diameter of the casing. (5) No oscillations were detected in the air‐filled hole, but because the time constants of the instrument are long in an air‐filled hole, the possibility of short period oscillations cannot be excluded.",10.1190/1.1439885
Interpretation Methods For Geophysical Exploration Of Reservoirs,Geophysical exploration methods can be valuable for the investigation of filled storage reservoirs. Impressed current circuits or natural ground potentials are analyzed for this purpose. General structural data are obtained from horizontal resistivity profiles. Ground bed details and seepage zones can be located by means of underwater equipotential surveys. Salinity and temperature measurements serve for the hydrological investigation of submerged springs and streams in natural lakes. The proposed interpretation methods can be readily adapted to specific local conditions.,10.1190/1.1438548
Relationship Between Deregowski‐Rocca And Hale Operators,"The relationship between two commonly used approaches, namely that of Deregowski and Rocca (1981) and Hale (1984), has not been specified explicitly. In this short note, we show an analytical interrelation between the two methods in terms of their kinematic behavior.",10.1190/1.1443519
Repeatability Issues Of 3-D Vsp Data,"Increased repeatability is recognized as one major issue for improving the time‐lapse seismic technology as a reservoir management tool. A 3-D vertical seismic profiling (VSP) data set, acquired over a period of two days, is used to analyze how repeatable a permanent installed geophone array can be and how repeatability changes with inaccuracies in source positioning. It is found that for a frequency range between 3.5 and 50 Hz, the difference root‐mean‐square (rms) level between two recorded traces belonging to two different shots is about 8%. This fact shows that there is a potential for acquiring very accurate time‐lapse seismic data by using a permanently installed downhole geophone array. Repeatability variation with increasing shot separation distances is analyzed, showing a rapid decrease in repeatability as the accuracy of the positioning of the repeat survey decreases. Horizontal geophone components show approximately the same degree of repeatability compared to the vertical component, but horizontal geophone data is slightly more sensitive to positioning errors. The results show that repeated 3-D VSP surveys (preferably using permanently installed geophone arrays) might be an efficient tool for detailed and precise monitoring of fluid and pressure changes within a hydrocarbon reservoir.",10.1190/1.1444671
Approximating Spheroid Inductive Responses Using Spheres,"Spheroid responses are important as limiting cases when modeling inductive responses of isolated metallic objects such as unexploded military ordnance. The response of high-permeability (μr ≥ 50) conductive spheroids of moderate aspect ratios (0.25–4) to excitation by uniform magnetic fields in the axial or transverse direction is approximated by the response of spheres of appropriate diameters, of the same conductivity and permeability, with magnitude rescaled based on the differing volumes, dc magnetizations, and high-frequency limit responses of the spheres and modelled spheroids. In the frequency domain, the scaled sphere responses agree within 5% of complex magnitudes for prolate spheroids and within 7% for oblate spheroids. The approximation is more accurate for source magnetic fields in the spheroid's shorter direction than in the spheroid's longer direction. In the time domain, the approximation describes spheroid responses over five decades of time after transmitter shutoff, with a maximum discrepancy of 20%.",10.1190/1.2187738
A Theoretical Overview Of Model-Based And Correlation-Based Redatuming Methods,"We review the equations for correlation-based redatuming methods. A correlation-based redatuming method uses natural-phase information in the data to time shift the weighted traces so they appear to be generated by sources (or recorded by geophones) shifted to a new location. This compares to model-based redatuming, which effectively time shifts the traces using traveltimes computed from a prior velocity model. For wavefield redatuming, the daylight imaging, interferometric imaging, reverse-time acoustics (RTA), and virtual-source methods all require weighted correlation of the traces with one another, followed by summation over all sources (and sometimes receivers). These methods differ from one another by their choice of weights. The least-squares interferometry and virtual-source imaging methods are potentially the most powerful because they account for the limited source and receiver aperture of the recording geometry. Interferometry, on the other hand, has the flexibility to select imaging conditions that target almost any type of event. Stationary-phase principles lead to a Fermat-based redatuming method known as redatuming by a seminatural Green's function. No crosscorrelation is needed, so it is less expensive than the other methods. Finally, Fermat's principle can be used to redatum traveltimes.",10.1190/1.2208967
Transient Electromagnetic Response Of A Three‐Dimensional Body In A Layered Earth,"The three‐dimensional (3-D) electromagnetic scattering problem is first formulated in the frequency domain in terms of an electric field volume integral equation. Three‐dimensional responses are then Fourier transformed with sine and cosine digital filters or with the decay spectrum. The digital filter technique is applied to a sparsely sampled frequency sounding, which is replaced by a cubic spline interpolating function prior to convolution with the digital filters. Typically, 20 to 40 frequencies at five to eight points per decade are required for an accurate solution. A calculated transient is usually in error after it has decayed more than six orders in magnitude from early to late time. The decay spectrum usually requires ten frequencies for a satisfactory solution. However, the solution using the decay spectrum appears to be less accurate than the solution using the digital filters, particularly after early times. Checks on the 3-D solution include reciprocity and convergence checks in the frequency domain, and a comparison of Fourier‐transformed responses with results from a direct time‐domain integral equation solution. The galvanic response of a 3-D conductor energized by a large rectangular loop is substantial when host currents are strong near the conductor. The more conductive the host, the longer the galvanic responses will persist. Large galvanic responses occur if a 3-D conductor is in contact with a conductive overburden. For a thin vertical dike embedded within a conductive host, the 3-D response is similar in form but differs in magnitude and duration from the 2-D response generated by two infinite line sources positioned parallel to the strike direction of the 2-D structure. We have used the 3-D solution to study the application of the central‐loop method to structural interpretation. The results suggest variations of thickness of conductive overburden and depth to sedimentary structure beneath volcanics can be mapped with one‐dimensional inversion. Successful 1-D inversions of 3-D transient soundings replace a 3-D conductor by a conducting layer at a similar depth. However, other possibilities include reduced thickness and resistivity of the 1-D host containing the body. Many different 1-D models can be fit to a transient sounding over a 3-D structure. Near‐surface, 3-D geologic noise will not permanently contaminate a central‐loop apparent resistivity sounding. The noise is band‐limited in time and eventually vanishes at late times.",10.1190/1.1442212
3D Edge-Preserving Smoothing And Applications,"This paper presents a new algorithm for reducing noise in seismic-impedance cubes while preserving structural and stratigraphic discontinuities or edges. The method divides the vicinity of every location in a 3D impedance cube into a number of blocks as the analysis point moves throughout the volume. At an interior discontinuity location with any 3D orientation, the process does not average values across the edge because this would blur the feature. Instead, the smoothest neighboring value is used. The main advantage of this 3D smoothing algorithm is that it preserves both lateral and vertical edges (i.e., the impedance boundaries) and improves the contrast in coherence attributes derived from impedance data.",10.1190/1.2213050
A New Technique For Layered Earth Magnetotelluric Inversion,"A new one‐dimensional (1-D) inverse method for layered‐earth interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) response curves is based on the method of Schmucker (1972). It involves transforming the E over B response into a nondimensional complex logarithm response, computing the partial derivatives  from a new algorithm for the logarithm response, and iteratively solving (by damped least squares) for the logarithm of the conductivity contrast between layers. Error bars for the layer conductivities are estimated by a simple application of propagation of errors assuming random and independent response errors. Backus‐Gilbert type smoothing kernels are also computed in order to specify the upper and lower depth limits on the conductivity model and to examine whether the layer conductivities are locally averaged values. The kernels are found to be an important aid in model interpretation  and emphasize the fact that layer conductivities are averages. The method is illustrated using artificial and real data.",10.1190/1.1441263
On The Extension Of Two‐Layer Methods Of Interpretation Of Earth Resistivity Data To Three And More Layers,"The two‐layer problem has been solved completely. Considerable success with the three‐layer problem has been attained by the extension of the two‐layer methods of Tagg and Roman making use of the principle established by Hummel. Some of the limitations of these methods are examined by the comparison of theoretical curves for various values of h2, ρ2, and ρ3 with help‐curves computed using Hummel's principle. In general it is found that the three‐layer problem of the type where a good conductor lies between two relatively poor conductors is more favorable for interpretation by the extension methods than is the opposite case where a poor conductor lies between two good conductors. The disadvantage in the latter case is that the field measurements must be carried to very much larger electrode spacings compared to the depth investigated. In all three‐layer problems where h2h1, a good interpretation for h1 is difficult. The four‐layer problem is much more difficult and only very special types lend themselves to the extension methods. The use of a large number of theoretical curves for curve matching is advocated both as a supplement to the extension methods and as a more powerful but slower method for the less favorable three‐layer problems as well as for problems of four or more layers.",10.1190/1.1439473
The Effect Of Interpolation On Imaging And Avo: A Viking Case Study,"The use of prestack interpolation prior to prestack migration to improve AVO analysis on image gathers is demonstrated on an exploration play. The interpolation achieves this improvement by reducing migration artifacts. AVO analysis attempts to estimate fundamental information from surface seismic data and likely will be used more frequently if the estimates can be more accurately produced. Land 3D seismic typically has poor and irregular sampling. This poor sampling creates migration noise, which is a material cause of inaccurate AVO estimates. Prestack 5D interpolation is applied prior to prestack migration and AVO analysis on the imaged gathers to address this noise problem. The interpolation algorithm includes offset and azimuth dimensions that preserve AVO information. This method is evaluated bycomparing the results to those of alternate approaches, such as superbinning, that suppress this kind of noise in AVO analysis. The evaluation is determined by comparing our ability to predict the reservoir quality of a gas-charged sandstone reservoir with 48 well penetrations. We compare migrated gathers, AVO attribute stacks, and attribute maps in our analysis. We also generate scatter plots of the AVO attribute values against measures of reservoir quality at the well control points to allow a quantitative measure of the improvements. The interpolation method yields gathers, stacks, and maps that all appear to be better resolved and less noisy than the other methods. The scatter plots demonstrate a measurable and significant improvement from the interpolation method, especially compared to superbinning. This work suggests interpolation before imaging, and imaging before AVO analysis, should be performed on land 3D surface seismic data.",10.1190/1.3475390
Removal Of Wavelet Dispersion From Ground‐Penetrating Radar Data,"Wavelet dispersion caused by frequency‐dependent attenuation is a common occurrence in ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) data, and is displayed in the radar image as a characteristic ""blurriness"" that increases with depth. Correcting for wavelet dispersion is an important step that should be performed before GPR data are used for either qualitative interpretation or the quantitative determination of subsurface electrical properties. Over the bandwidth of a GPR wavelet, the attenuation of electromagnetic waves in many geological materials is approximately linear with frequency. As a result, the change in shape of a radar pulse as it propagates through these materials can be well described using one parameter, Q*, related to the slope of the linear region. Assuming that all subsurface materials can be characterized by some Q* value, the problem of estimating and correcting for wavelet dispersion becomes one of determining Q* in the subsurface and deconvolving its effects using an inverse‐Q filter. We present a method for the estimation of subsurface Q* from reflection GPR data based on a technique developed for seismic attenuation tomography. Essentially, Q* is computed from the downshift in the dominant frequency of the GPR signal with time. Once Q* has been obtained, we propose a damped‐least‐squares inverse‐Q filtering scheme based on a causal, linear model for constant‐Q wave propagation as a means of removing wavelet dispersion. Tests on synthetic and field data indicate that these steps can be very effective at enhancing the resolution of the GPR image.",10.1190/1.1581068
An Efficient Step-Length Formula For Correlative Least-Squares Reverse Time Migration,"In correlative least-squares reverse time migration (CLSRTM), the estimation of the optimal step size is usually determined by fitting a parabola and finding its minimum; it involves at least two times extra reading of all seismic records, which significantly lowers the efficiency of the algorithm. To improve the efficiency of the CLSRTM algorithm, we have deduced an analytical step-length (ASL) formula based on the linear property of the demigration operator. Numerical examples performed with the data synthetized by the Marmousi and Sigsbee2A models were used to test its validity. In complex models with imperfect migration velocity, such as the Sigabee2A model, our formula makes the value of the objective function converges to a much smaller minimum. Additional numerical tests performed with the data either acquired irregularly or contaminated by different noise levels verify the robustness of the ASL formula. Compared with the commonly used parabolic search method, the ASL formula is much more efficient because it is free from an extra estimation of the value of the objective function.",10.1190/geo2015-0529.1
Fast Computation Of The 3-D Radon Transform,"Radon transforms can be used to decompose seismic shot records into sets of plane waves and, as such, are a useful processing tool. Haneveld and Herman (1990) discussed a fast algorithm for the numerical evaluation of both the forward and inverse 2-D Radon transforms. They showed that, by rewriting the transform as a convolution, the computation time is proportional to Nlog2N, instead of N2 (where N denotes the number of input and output traces). In the present paper, we describe a similar method for the computation of the 3-D Radon transform for the case of rotational symmetry (see also Mallick and Frazer, 1987; McCowan and Brysk, 1989). With the aid of asymptotic techniques, the 3-D Radon transform is recast into a form similar to the 2-D Radon transform after which similar acceleration techniques are used. We have implemented and tested the fast transform on synthetic as well as on real data and found that the computation time of the fast 3-D Radon transform is indeed proportional to Nlog2N.",10.1190/1.1444138
Quantifying The Effect Of Capillarity On Attenuation And Dispersion In Patchy-Saturated Rocks,"Waves in patchy-saturated rocks are attenuated through the mechanism of wave-induced pressure diffusion. Previous studies reveal that attenuation and phase-velocity dispersion depend on the fluid patch size and distribution. These patch characteristics in turn can be influenced by capillary forces. The effect of capillarity on wave attenuation in patchy-saturated rocks is not fully understood. We studied the combined effects of wave-induced pressure diffusion and capillarity on acoustic signatures. To do so we made use of the concept of patch membrane stiffness as a macroscopic expression of capillarity. We incorporated the membrane stiffness into the continuous random media model of patchy saturation. The membrane stiffness is associated with a pressure discontinuity at patch interfaces. This pressure discontinuity impedes wave-induced pressure diffusion and, therefore, reduces wave attenuation. Conversely, the phase velocity increases due to additional capillarity reinforcement. We applied this capillarity-extended random media model to interpret velocity-saturation relations (VSR) and attenuation-saturation relations (ASR) retrieved from an ultrasonically monitored core flooding experiment. Because the fluid distribution is approximately known from accompanying computerized tomographic images, all but one required model input parameters can be inferred. The elusive input parameter is a shape factor quantifying the geometric irregularity of the pore channels. We found, however, that the experimental data can be consistently modeled only if the capillarity effect is accounted for. The results suggested that wave-induced fluid-pressure diffusion at mesoscopic patches in conjunction with capillary action can have important implications for interpreting ultrasonic VSR and ASR in patchy-saturated rocks.",10.1190/geo2013-0425.1
Virtual Real Source: Source Signature Estimation Using Seismic Interferometry,"Knowledge of the seismic source signature is crucial in numerousproblems in exploration seismology, especially in full-waveform inversion. However, existing methods of source signature estimation like statistical methods and well-log-based methods suffer from several drawbacks arising from assumptions such as whiteness of the reflectivity series and the minimum-phase character of the wavelet. Also, estimation of the source signature using wave-theoretical methods requires the recording of the wavefield and its normal derivative or additional recordings above the receiver surface which are not always available. We introduce a method, called the Virtual Real Source, of extracting the source signature based on the theory of seismic interferometry, also known as the virtual source method. This method is independent of the assumptions and drawbacks of the above-mentioned methods. The only requirement for the method of Virtual Real Source is to have a virtual source location coincide with the physical shot position whose source signature is desired. The virtual source location does not necessarily have to be a zero-offset receiver because one can use interpolation for it. The source signature is extracted by deconvolving the real recording at a receiver from the virtual source recording. Through modeling examples, we show that Virtual Real Source produces accurate source signatures even for complicated subsurface structures and source signatures, and is robust in the presence of noise. Source signature of every shot in a survey can be extracted reliably as long as the source signatures have similar amplitude spectra. The phase spectrum of the source signature is always extracted accurately even if it varies randomly from one shot to another. The Virtual Real Source applied on a 2D streamer data set from the North Viking Graben in the North Sea extracts all the airgun signatures with the main pulse and the bubble oscillation.",10.1190/geo2013-0069.1
High‐Resolution Velocity Notch Filter Without Gibbs Effect,"A new technique has been developed to reject or pass constant velocity coherent energy. Compared to the widely used frequency‐wavenumber (ο‐k) filtering method, this technique does not show either spatial aliasing or Gibbs effect. The filter operator is designed analytically as an infinite continuous function in the ο‐k domain. This function has the property that, when transformed by the integral inverse Fourier transform into the time‐space (t‐x) domain, it becomes a short discrete function with the same properties as the continuous infinite function in the ο‐k domain. No sampling or truncation of the filter operator is needed, hence no Gibbs oscillations are introduced into the operator impulse response or into the filtered data. Because of the extremely high‐velocity resolution and dynamic range of the designed coherent energy filter, it is particularly useful for the up‐ and downgoing energy separation on the vertical seismic profile data and for the peg‐leg multiples attenuation.",10.1190/1.1444128
Refraction Tomography Using A Waveform-Inversion Back-Propagation Technique,"To compute the steepest-descent direction, we apply a waveform-inversion back-propagation algorithm based on the symmetry of the Green's function for the wave equation (i.e., the adjoint state of the wave equation), allowing us to avoid directly computing and saving sensitivities (Fréchet derivatives). From numerical examples of a block-anomaly model and the Marmousi-2 model, we confirm that traveltimes computed from a damped monochromatic wavefield are compatible with those picked from synthetic data, and our refraction-tomography method can provide initial models for Kirchhoff prestack depth migration.",10.1190/1.2194522
Transient Analytic Point‐Source Response Of A Layered Acoustic Medium: Part Ii,In part I (this issue) analytic methods are described for propagating directly in the time domain the full wave field of transient plane waves at arbitrary incidence angles through parallel acoustic homogeneous layers. The theory of part I is used here to compute transient point‐source responses by way of integrating the transient plane‐wave responses over various (real and nonreal) incidence angles. At first the complete transient point‐source reflection (transmission) responses are formulated with the help of the transient Sommerfeld‐Weyl integral that was developed previously by us. This leads to a transient solution in form of an infinite integral over incidence angles involving an (angle‐dependent) integrand that is a time‐convolution between a transient reflectivity (transmissivity) function and an inverse transient analytic square root operator. The transient Sommerfeld‐Weyl integral solution is then proven to be causal. This causality provides the starting point for formulating exact transient point‐source responses in terms of integrals over a finite range of incidence angles only.,10.1190/1.1442015
Some Neglected Aspects Of Chemical Exploration,"In a general discussion of geochemical exploration for petroleum, some of the problems particularly related to the soil‐analysis method are considered in detail. It is suggested that with technique now available for gas‐analysis, the older method of soil‐gas sampling may avoid some of the difficulties inherent in the soil‐sampling method.",10.1190/1.1441811
Interpolation Of Geophysical Data Using Continuous Global Surfaces,"We apply the new methodology to a regional gravity compilation with a highly heterogeneous sampling density. The industry standard minimum‐curvature algorithms and several scale‐dependent CGS methods are unable to adapt to the varying data density without introducing spurious artifacts. In contrast, the thin‐plate spline is scale independent and produces an excellent fit. When applied to an aeromagnetic data set with relatively uniform sampling, the thin‐plate spline does not significantly improve results over a standard minimum‐curvature algorithm.",10.1190/1.1527081
"Estimation Of Phase Velocities And Q‐Factors From Zero‐Offset, Vertical Seismic Profile Data","In seismic processing, we face the problem of characterizing the effect of anelastic attenuation on the seismic signal during propagation. To solve this problem, approximate physical properties of the porous fluid‐filled rock are needed. We give a strategy for estimating effective parameters governing absorption and dispersion of waves in viscoelastic media by inverting zero‐offset vertical seismic profiling (VSP) data acquired in a medium with plane horizontal layers. The VSP data are filtered such that all energy except for the direct downgoing wave and the primary reflected wave from each interface is zeroed. This procedure requires a model with layer thicknesses greater than a minimum limit. A stack of thin layers must be replaced by a layer with average physical properties and with thickness exceeding the required minimum. The model parameter vector is partitioned into two vectors. The first contains the frequency‐dependent complex propagation velocity in each layer, and is evaluated over the frequency band where the signal‐to‐noise ratio is acceptable. In the second vector, the geophone‐to‐formation coupling factors, which are assumed to be frequency‐independent, are gathered. It is straightforward to determine both the frequency‐dependent phase velocities and the frequency‐dependent quality (Q‐) factors from the frequency‐dependent propagation velocities. We assume that layer boundaries and layer densities can be obtained from well logs. We give the equations for a simplified forwardmodeling scheme and the equations for the solution of the nonlinear inverse problem. The algorithm is applied to both synthetic and real data. Inversion of synthetic data shows that the phase velocities can be satisfactorily estimated, and that Q‐factors below approximately 50 are well‐resolved, even for large errors in the geophone‐to‐formation coupling factors. The estimated phase velocities from the real data behave fairly stable as a function of frequency. The results for the quality factors are less conclusive, but the low Q‐factors may be of correct size.",10.1190/1.1443612
Ore Detection And Grade Estimation In The Sudbury Mines Using Thermal Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy,"This pilot study investigated the usefulness of thermal infrared reflectance (TIR) spectroscopy to estimate ore grade in an underground environment and to separate ore‐bearing samples from their host rocks. Work was carried out under laboratory conditions to test the initial concept; all samples had naturally broken faces to mimic the situation in a freshly blasted underground opening. A total of 26 samples, including massive and disseminated ores, were collected from eight mines around the Sudbury basin in Ontario. Rock surfaces were measured wet and dry to address environmental conditions encountered underground. To separate barren rocks from ores and for ore‐grade estimation, an important finding of this research is that, in the region of 1319cm-1, most known silicate minerals converge to a common reflectance minima (1.5%), but massive and disseminated sulfides have distinctly higher reflectance. Individual sulfide minerals (chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite), however, do not reveal diagnostic features in this spectral region. When sulfides are disseminated in the host rock, the average reflectance of the rock increases but the correlation with abundance is not systematic. However, sulfide concentration as a function of continuum‐removed reflectance (CRR) is systematic. The empirical correlation between CRR at 1319cm-1 versus the total sulfide concentration, estimated via thin‐section point counts, gives a coefficient of determination value (R2) of 0.93 for measurement of dry and wet surfaces when averaged. Similar results are observed when dry and wet locations are analyzed separately. The relationship demonstrates the feasibility to estimate total sulfide concentration from TIR reflectance data even when samples are wet.",10.1190/1.1487111
A Cooperative Plan In Student Education,Effective exploration is a combination of well designed equipment and competent personnel. The latter factor attains special importance as exploration problems become more complex and competition increases with other industries for scientific manpower. A cooperative plan for undergraduate university students is described wherein aptitudes are measured in a guided course of actual exposure to various phases of petroleum exploration.,10.1190/1.1437907
The Elastic Anisotropy Of Clay Minerals,"The layered structure of clay minerals produces large elastic anisotropy due to the presence of strong covalent bonds within layers and weaker electrostatic bonds in between. Technical difficulties associated with small grain size preclude experimental measurement of single-crystal elastic moduli. However, theoretical calculations of the complete elastic tensors of several clay minerals have been reported, using either first-principle calculations based on density functional theory or molecular dynamics. Because of the layered microstructure, the elastic stiffness tensor obtained from such calculations can be approximated to good accuracy as a transversely isotropic (TI) medium. The TI-equivalent elastic moduli of clay minerals indicate that Thomsen's anisotropy parameters ϵ and γ are large and positive, whereas δ is small or negative. A least-squares inversion for the elastic properties of a best-fitting equivalent TI medium consisting of two isotropic layers to the elastic properties of clay minerals indicates that the shear modulus of the stiffest layer is considerably larger than the softest layer, consistent with the expected high compliance of the interlayer region in clay minerals. It is anticipated that the elastic anisotropy parameters derived from the best-fitting TI approximation to the elastic stiffness tensor of clay minerals will find applications in rock physics for seismic imaging, amplitude variation with offset analysis, and geomechanics.",10.1190/geo2016-0005.1
Solving Elastic Wave Equations With The Hartley Method,"Elastic modeling is one of the basic approaches to determining the seismic response of subsurface structures. There are different numerical techniques for computing the solution of the elastic wave equation, such as the finite‐difference, the finite‐element, and the Fourier methods.",10.1190/1.1443040
Seismic Data Interpolation Beyond Aliasing Using Regularized Nonstationary Autoregression,"Seismic data are often inadequately or irregularly sampled along spatial axes. Irregular sampling can produce artifacts in seismic imaging results. We have developed a new approach to interpolate aliased seismic data based on adaptive prediction-error filtering (PEF) and regularized nonstationary autoregression. Instead of cutting data into overlapping windows (patching), a popular method for handling nonstationarity, we obtain smoothly nonstationary PEF coefficients by solving a global regularized least-squares problem. We employ shaping regularization to control the smoothness of adaptive PEFs. Finding the interpolated traces can be treated as another linear least-squares problem, which solves for data values rather than filter coefficients. Compared with existing methods, the advantages of the proposed method include an intuitive selection of regularization parameters and fast iteration convergence. The technique was tested on benchmark synthetic and field data to prove it can successfully reconstruct data with decimated or missing traces.",10.1190/geo2010-0231.1
Sosie: A New Tool For Marine Seismology,"The development of marine reflection methods over the past few years has shown the technical and economic advantages that can be derived from highly repetitive nonexplosive sources. Pursuing the idea to its limits the Geophyiscal Division of SNPA's Research Center has designed and implemented a new seismic method. The source energy is released into the water in the form of discrete pulses of the same sign and essentially the same amplitude, according to a long pseudo‐random sequence. This process is not restricted to any particular source; it can be used with a number of different sources, provided they can reach a sufficient rate of repetition. The basic principle has been checked with a sparker, chosen for its flexibility; however, conventional sources such as air and steam guns were also tested. Comparison section indicate improved quality for the new method due to multiplication of seismic ray paths and a more adequate frequency spectrum. Additional benefits are maximum flexibility in recording and processing and reduction of costs.",10.1190/1.1440366
Nomogram For The Complete Interpretation Of Spontaneous Potential Profiles Over Sheet‐Like And Cylindrical Two‐Dimensional Sources,"Interpretation of elongated SP anomalies is usually accomplished by assigning two‐dimensional (2-D) shapes such as inclined sheets and horizontal cylinders to the source. However, since the shapes of the profiles are similar, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the source as cylindrical or sheet‐like from a given field profile. By defining two characteristic ratios from anomalies between the two extrema on the profile, we present a nomogram which not only helps identify the shape of the 2-D anomaly source, but also facilitates estimating all the parameters. Using this nomogram a field profile can be interpreted in a very short time with ease and accuracy. The method is demonstrated on two examples. Error response of the parameters estimated due to errors in data was studied through imposing ±5 percent to ±25 percent errors in the two characteristic ratios in two synthetic profiles due to a cylinder and a sheet. While the results on the cylinder showed negligible errors, the percent errors for the sheet model, in general, are less than the percent errors imposed.",10.1190/1.1441986
Analysis For Magnetite Utilizing Magnetic Susceptibility,"The analysis for magnetite or ""magnetite equivalent"" by means of magnetic susceptibility is more rapid, lower in cost, and in general, as precise as other methods of analysis. ""Magnetite equivalent"" analysis is affected by grain size if the individual particles are less than 40 microns in diameter, by the remnant magnetization if greater than about 12 percent of saturation magnetization, and by the presence of other magnetic minerals. The presence of other magnetic minerals does not reflect as great an error in the final result using the susceptibility method as in other methods. Davis tube separation as a method for magnetite analysis is affected by other magnetic minerals but is mainly dependent upon degree of mineral liberation by grinding. Chemical analysis with the subsequent calculation of magnetite content is in error due to presence of other iron‐bearing minerals whether magnetic or nonmagnetic and is particularly affected by the presence of metallic iron from sample preparation. Metallic iron apparently enters solution by the following reaction: ",10.1190/1.1439783
Minimizing Field Operations In Shallow 3‐D Seismic Reflection Surveying,"By appropriately decimating a comprehensive shallow 3‐D seismic reflection data set recorded across unconsolidated sediments in northern Switzerland, we have investigated the potential and limitations of four different source‐receiver acquisition patterns. For the original survey, more than 12 000 shots and 18 000 receivers deployed on a 3×3‐m grid resulted in common midpoint (CMP) data with an average fold of ∼40 across a 322.5×420.0‐m area. A principal goal of our investigation was to determine an acquisition strategy capable of producing reliable subsurface images in a more efficient and cost‐effective manner. Field efforts for the four tested acquisition strategies were approximately 50%, 50%, 25%, and 20% of the original effort. All four data subsets were subjected to a common processing sequence. Static corrections, top‐mute functions, and stacking velocities were estimated individually for each subset. Because shallow reflections were difficult to discern on shot and CMP gathers generated with the lowest density acquisition pattern (20% field effort) such that dependable top‐mute functions could not be estimated, data resulting from this acquisition pattern were not processed to completion. Of the three fully processed data subsets, two (50% field effort and 25% field effort) yielded 3‐D migrated images comparable to that derived from the entire data set, whereas the third (50% field effort) resulted in good‐quality images only in the shallow subsurface because of a lack of far‐offset data. On the basis of these results, we concluded that all geological objectives associated with our particular study site, which included mapping complex lithological units and their intervening shallow dipping boundaries, would have been achieved by conducting a 3‐D seismic reflection survey that was 75% less expensive than the original one.",10.1190/1.1487118
Porosity Perturbations And Poroelastic Compressibilities,"The Biot-Gassmann (BG) poroelasticity theory is based on the assumption of a microhomogeneous solid frame. This means that it considers the solid frame to be homogeneous at the pore-scale level. If the solid frame is built out of two or more solid constituents at the pore-scale level, then the porous rock can be considered microinhomogeneous. Although in a macroscopic sense, it still is homogeneous. Porosity changes during deformation of microinhomogeneous rocks lead to poroelastic compressibilities that are not compatible with the BG theory. The key to modeling the compressive response of microinhomogeneous rocks is the porosity perturbation equation known from the volume-averaging-based poroelasticity framework. This porosity perturbation equation entails an effective stress coefficient that can be different from unity. Only if this porosity effective stress coefficient equals unity can the porosity perturbation equation implicit to Biot's theory be recovered. The porosity perturbation equation was reconciled with the poroelastic compressibility definitions suitable for pressure-cell experiments. These compressibilities were parameterized in terms of the porosity effective stress coefficient. The results provide a means to consistently interpret pressure-cell experiments on Berea sandstone samples in which a difference between the unjacketed bulk and pore compressibilities has been found.",10.1190/geo2012-0129.1
"Palmietfontein Kimberlite Pipe, South Africa—A Case History","The Palmietfontein kimberlite pipe is located 150 km northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was emplaced at the contact between mafic rocks of the Bushveld complex and syenites of the Pilanesberg complex, and coincides with the intersection of two major faults. Palmietfontein is one of the larger known kimberlite pipes in South Africa; it has a surface area of 12 ha and is diamondiferous. The present geophysical study was designed to assist in planning an extensive program of trenching and drilling. Unweathered kimberlite has geophysical responses very similar to the country rock at Palmietfontein. Weathering and alteration of the upper 50 m of the pipe, however, have resulted in various physical changes, which has made the target amenable to investigation by various geophysical techniques. The surveys used in this study are gravity, electrical, seismic refraction, and airborne and ground magnetics and electromagnetics (EM). The boundary of the pipe was accurately defined, and the dip of the wallrock contact was determined by using various models and combinations of techniques. A small satellite body of kimberlite was also discovered during the course of this investigation. The most suitable techniques for kimberlite prospecting, particularly when the top portion of the kimberlite is weathered, are airborne EM and magnetics, combined with the Slingram ground-EM system. For more quantitative results, gravity and seismic surveys should be used.",10.1190/1.1442697
Automatic 1-D Inversion Of Magnetotelluric Data: Finding The Simplest Possible Model That Fits The Data,"We demonstrate that automatic layered inversion of plane‐wave electromagnetic data can be carried out by modifying standard least‐squares inversion schemes. The modifications include a logarithmic reparameterization of the unknown model parameters, whereby all layer parameters are forced to remain within given bounds. However, the most important modification to help the optimization process find the best model and to avoid local minima is to split the data into several subbands, starting from the highest frequencies. By this stripping procedure, the shallower part of the model becomes well estimated first. As more data are introduced, more layers may be required to improve the data fit. The new inversion procedure has been applied to many sets of theoretical data representing increasingly complicated layering that is often found in near‐surface studies. The main result of these simulations is that there is a very strong coupling between the resolution power of plane‐wave data and their random errors. Particularly at small error levels around 1–2%, the resolution power increases greatly. For larger error levels the fine layering of the models becomes smeared, and only the variations in thickness of the upper layer can be resolved. A comparison with the popular ""Occam"" procedure shows, not unexpectedly, that a blocky earth is best represented by a blocky earth model rather than by a smooth model.",10.1190/1.1444776
An Efficient Multiscale Method For Time-Domain Waveform Tomography,"This efficient multiscale method for time-domain waveform tomography incorporates filters that are more efficient than Hamming-window filters. A strategy for choosing optimal frequency bands is proposed to achieve computational efficiency in the time domain. A staggered-grid, explicit finite-difference method with fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time is used for forward modeling and the adjoint calculation. The adjoint method is utilized in inverting for an efficient computation of the gradient directions. In the multiscale approach, multifrequency data and multiple grid sizes are used to overcome somewhat the severe local minima problem of waveform tomography. The method is applied successfully to 1D and 2D heterogeneous models; it can accurately recover low- and high-wavenumber components of the velocity models. The inversion result for the 2D model demonstrates that the multiscale method is computationally efficient and converges faster than a conventional, single-scale method.",10.1190/1.3151869
Velocity‐Stack And Slant‐Stack Stochastic Inversion,"Normal moveout (NMO) and stacking, an important step in analysis of reflection seismic data, involves summation of seismic data over paths represented by a family of hyperbolic curves. This summation process is a linear transformation and maps the data into what might be called a velocity space: a two‐dimensional set of points indexed by time and velocity. Examination of data in velocity space is used for analysis of subsurface velocities and filtering of undesired coherent events (e.g., multiples), but the filtering step is useful only if an approximate inverse to the NMO and stack operation is available. One way to effect velocity filtering is to use the operator LT (defined as NMO and stacking) and its adjoint L as a transform pair, but this leads to unacceptable filtered output. Designing a better estimated inverse to L than LT is a generalization of the inversion problem of computerized tomography: deconvolving out the point‐spread function after back projection. The inversion process is complicated by missing data, because surface seismic data are recorded only within a finite spatial aperture on the Earth's surface. Our approach to solving the problem of an ill‐conditioned or nonunique inverse L-1, brought on by missing data, is to design a stochastic inverse to L. Starting from a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator, a system of equations can be set up in which a priori information is incorporated into a sparseness measure: the output of the stochastic inverse is forced to be locally focused, in order to obtain the best possible resolution in velocity space. The size of the resulting nonlinear system of equations is immense, but using a few iterations with a gradient descent algorithm is adequate to obtain a reasonable solution. This theory may also be applied to other large, sparse linear operators. The stochastic inverse of the slant‐stack operator (a particular form of the Radon transform), can be developed in a parallel manner, and will yield an accurate slant‐stack inverse pair.",10.1190/1.1441893
Implementation Of Marine Seismic Source Wavefields In Finite-Difference Methods Using Wavefield Injection,"We have developed a method for implementing source wavefields in finite-difference (FD) schemes for marine seismic modeling, migration, and inversion. By using the wavefield injection technique, it is possible to inject arbitrary source wavefields into an FD grid. We have assumed that the notional source signatures from each gun in an air-gun array and their positions are known. The source wavefield is extrapolated to a specified surface below the true source positions using analytical Green's functions. On this surface, the pressure and its vertical derivative are inserted into the FD grid. The wavefield propagating from this surface will then propagate downward and appear as if it came from the true source position. The source positions do not need to coincide with the FD grid points, and the free-surface reflection coefficient for the source ghost can be specified; i.e., it can deviate from −1, and it can be frequency dependent. These features are possible because of the analytical extrapolation step. The presented method allows modeling of any kind of marine seismic source as long as the notional source signature and radiation pattern from each individual source element is known. A simple full-waveform inversion example shows that it is important to honor the source geometry in forward modeling of seismic data.",10.1190/geo2016-0026.1
"Large-Scale 3D Inversion Of Marine Magnetotelluric Data: Case Study From The Gemini Prospect, Gulf Of Mexico","Three-dimensional magnetotelluric (MT) inversion is an emerging technique for offshore hydrocarbon exploration. We have developed a new approach to the 3D inversion of MT data, based on the integral equation method. The Tikhonov regularization and physical constraint have been used to obtain a stable and reasonable solution of the inverse problem. The method is implemented in a fully parallel computer code. We have applied the developed method and software for the inversion of marine MT data collected by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) in the Gemini prospect, Gulf of Mexico. The inversion domain was discretized into 1.6 million cells. It took nine hours to complete 51 iterations on the 832-processor cluster with a final misfit between the observed and predicted data of 6.2%. The inversion results reveal a resistive salt structure, which is confirmed by a comparison with the seismic data. These inversion results demonstrate that resistive geoelectrical structures like salt domes can be mapped with reasonable accuracy using the 3D inversion of marine MT data.",10.1190/1.3526299
Correlation Of Random Wavefields: An Interdisciplinary Review,"This paper presents an interdisciplinary review of the correlation properties of random wavefields. We expose several important theoretical results of various fields, ranging from time reversal in acoustics to transport theory in condensed matter physics. Using numerical simulations, we introduce the correlation process in an intuitive manner. We establish a fruitful mapping between time reversal and correlation, which enables us to transpose many known results from acoustics to seismology. We show that the multiple-scattering formalism developed in condensed matter physics provides a rigorous basis to analyze the field correlations in disordered media. We discuss extensively the various factors controlling and affecting the retrieval of the Green's function of a complex medium from the correlation of either noise or coda. Acoustic imaging of complex samples in the laboratory and seismic tomography of geologic structures give a glimpse of the promising wide range of applications of the correlation method.",10.1190/1.2213356
Shear‐Wave Detection In Near‐Surface Seismic Refraction Studles,"The U. S. Geological Survey, on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has begun investigations designed to relate the data obtained from seismic refraction profiles to the physical properties of lunar analog earth materials. The velocity of shear waves is a significant property, but the recording of these waves presented a serious problem.",10.1190/1.1439829
"Fourier Reconstruction Of Nonuniformly Sampled, Aliased Seismic Data","There are numerous methods for interpolating uniformly sampled, aliased seismic data, but few can handle the combination of nonuniform sampling and aliasing. We combine the principles of Fourier reconstruction of nonaliased, nonuniformly sampled data with the ideas of frequency-wavenumber   (f-k)   interpolation of aliased, uniformly sampled data in a new two-step algorithm. In the first step, we estimate the Fourier coefficients at the lower nonaliased temporal frequencies from the nonuniformly sampled data. The coefficients are then used in the second step as an a priori model to distinguish between aliased and nonaliased energy at the higher, aliased temporal frequencies. By using a nonquadratic model penalty in the inversion, both the artifacts in the Fourier domain from nonuniform sampling and the aliased energy are suppressed. The underlying assumption is that events are planar; therefore, the algorithm is applied to seismic data in overlapping spatiotemporal windows.",10.1190/1.2399442

3-D Magnetic Imaging Using Conjugate Gradients,"A 3-D inversion approach is outlined that determines a distribution of susceptibility that produces a given magnetic anomaly. The subsurface model consists of a 3-D array of rectangular blocks, each with a constant susceptibility. The inversion incorporates a model norm that allows smoothing and depth‐weighting of the solution. Since the number of parameters can be many thousands, even for small problems, the linear system of equations is inverted using a preconditioned conjugate gradient approach. This reduces memory requirements and avoids large matrix multiplications. The method is used to determine the 3-D susceptibility distribution responsible for the Temagami magnetic anomaly in southern Ontario, Canada.",10.1190/1.1444214
"Geophysical History Of Mamou Field, Evangeline Parish, Louisiana","This paper presents a chronological historical record of the geophysical activity in the area near the town of Mamou, Louisiana which subsequently led to the discovery of the Mamou Oil Field. The successive stages of geophysical exploration were: 1. Mechanical seismograph refraction survey by North American Exploration Company (German company) in August 1926 for Magnolia‐Union Sulphur‐Harry Hanszen. 2. Torsion balance survey by Shell Oil Company in 1934. 3. Magnetometer survey by Atlantic Refining Company in 1936. 4. Torsion balance survey by Atlantic Refining Company in 1936. 5. Gravity meter survey by Magnolia Petroleum Company the latter part of 1942 and early part of 1943. 6. Three weeks' seismic work by Petty Geophysical Engineering Company for Magnolia Petroleum Company in June 1943. 7. A few weeks' work by General Geophysical Company for Cities Service Oil Company in June, 1943. 8. Detailed seismic survey by Independent Exploration Company for Magnolia Petroleum Company from November, 1943 to June, 1945. The discovery well, Magnolia's No. 1 J. B. Morein, was completed December 28, 1945 through perforations from 11,520 feet to 11,530 feet, producing 208 barrels of 46.3 gravity oil and 770 MCF gas per day through 8/64 inch choke. There are three producing horizons in the upper part of the Wilcox group. The first, or Morein stringer, is approximately 5 feet thick and lies about 18 feet above the second, or Morein sand, which has 19 feet average production thickness. The third, or Deshotels sand, has an average productive thickness of 10 feet and is approximately 230 feet below the Morein sand. Twenty producers and five dry holes were drilled. The field has been unitized and is being water‐flooded. Total production of the field to January 1, 1954 was 2,498,373 barrels. December, 1953 production was 20,604 barrels.",10.1190/1.1438024
"The Geophysics Of The Tomball Oil Field, Harris County, Texas","The geophysical and drilling discovery of the Tomball oil field, Harris County, Texas, marks one of the important mile‐posts in the course of Gulf Coast geophysics. The success of Tomball arrived at that troublesome period when refraction seismographs were on the way out, and reflection seismographs were dubiously bidding for entrance, when Gulf Coast geologists and geophysicists were sorely stressed to change their ideas, their tools and technique to meet the challenge of existing indeterminative, ""marginal"" geophysical prospects, and when an oil field discovery on this new type of geophysical prediction was needed to reestablish confidence and insure cooperation on the part of management.",10.1190/1.1486495
Geometrical Spreading In A Layered Transversely Isotropic Medium With Vertical Symmetry Axis,"Comparison with numerical ray tracing demonstrates that the weak anisotropy approximation to geometrical spreading is accurate for P‐waves. It is less accurate for SV‐waves, but has qualitatively the correct form. For P waves, the nonhyperbolic equation for geometrical spreading compares favorably with ray‐tracing results for offset‐depth ratios less than five. For SV‐waves, the analytical approximation is accurate only at small offsets, and breaks down at offset‐depth ratios less than unity. The numerical results are in agreement with the range of validity for the nonhyperbolic traveltime equations.",10.1190/1.1635062
Werner Deconvolution For Variable Altitude Aeromagnetic Data,"The standard Werner deconvolution method is extended to include the effects of variable sensor altitude but this leads to a deconvolution algorithm that is unstable for slowly changing flight height. By expressing the sensor altitude as a linear function of horizontal position (within a specified window), we show that the numerical instability can be avoided. The subsequent selection and averaging of the raw solutions is controlled by three parameters that can be adjusted to specific survey data characteristics. Results for an aeromagnetic survey over Vancouver Island, British Columbia show that, in comparison with the variable altitude approach, the standard Werner method produces unacceptable errors when applied to variable altitude data.",10.1190/1.1443362
Models For Thermoelastic Attenuation Of Waves In Heterogeneous Solids,"Some one‐dimensional models of a heterogeneous solid are presented consisting of a succession of slabs with different anharmonic properties. The equation for the temperature variation in these models due to passage of a longitudinal elastic wave can be solved exactly in the approximation of weak attenuation. The solutions are given in terms of the forced oscillation plus the temperature wave solutions to the homogeneous equation needed to match the boundary conditions of continuity of temperature and thermal current. Thermoelastic attenuation due to this temperature variation is compared to that of Zener's classical approach. For periodic arrangement of slab properties or upon use of Zener's boundary condition of vanishing thermal current, the temperature‐wave approach reproduces Zener‐type attenuation. However, a succession of slabs with a random, uncorrelated distribution of the Gruneisen constant leads to a new result with attenuation proportional to the three‐halves power of the wave frequency in the low‐frequency limit. The results are discussed in the context of seismoacoustic wave attenuation.",10.1190/1.1441718
Generalized Compact Gravity Inversion,"Extending the compact gravity inversion technique by incorporating a priori information about the maximum compactness of the anomalous sources along several axes provides versatility. Thus, the method may also incorporate information about limits in the axes lengths or greater concentration of mass along one or more directions. The judicious combination of different constraints on the anomalous mass distribution allows the introduction of several kinds of a priori information about the (arbitrary) shape of the sources. This method is particularly applicable to constant, linear density sources such as mineralizations along faults and intruded sills, dikes, and laccoliths in a sedimentary basin. The correct source density must be known with a maximum uncertainty of 40 percent; otherwise, the inversion produces thicker bodies for densities smaller than the true value and vice‐versa. Because of the limitations of the inverse gravity problem, the proposed technique requires an empirical technique to analyze the sensitivity of solutions to uncertainties in the a priori information. The proposed technique is based on a finite number of acceptable solutions, presumably representative of the ambiguity region. By using standard statistical techniques, each parameter is assigned a coefficient measuring its uncertainty. The known hematite and magnetite ore body shape, in the vicinity of Iron Mountain, MO, was reproduced quite well using this inversion technique.",10.1190/1.1443534
A Rapid Method For Measuring The Profile Components Of Horizontal And Vertical Gravity Gradients,"The trend in gravity exploration in the past years indicates the rather remarkable fact that a method of low resolving power (the gravity meter) has replaced one of higher resolving power (the torsion balance). This is entirely due to the superior speed of the former and suggests an instrument and procedure in which observation time is reduced by (1) reduction in number of quantities measured; (2) use of a reference direction near that of the maximum effect; (3) elimination of the torsionless position as unknown; (4) reduction in period, with compensating increase in optical sensitivity; (5) stabilization of thermal conditions. These objectives are attained by (1) measuring the profile components of gradients and curvature values, preferably at right angles to the assumed strike; whereby, for an ideal two‐dimensional feature, also the vertical gravity gradient is obtained, and the vertical and horizontal gravity components may be calculated by integration; (2) by holding the torsionless position constant with temperature control; (3) by decreasing the period and observation time to 3–4 minutes, and (4) by using a beam arrangement which will give the gradient in only one azimuth, and the profile gradient of the horizontal gravity component in a second azimuth if desired. Latitude and terrain corrections are also somewhat simplified by the proposed procedure.",10.1190/1.1445035
The Application Of Map Migration To 2-D Migrated Data,"Two‐dimensional migrated time interpretations are used in a novel application of map migration. This is done by following the seismic migration along the 2-D lines by a map migration in a direction orthogonal to the lines, thus achieving a fully 3-D migrated representation of the subsurface. In addition to modifying the 2-D times and positions, this approach corrects the amplitudes of the 2-D migrated data, which suffer from being corrupted by focusing or defocusing because of the reflector curvature orthogonal to the line direction. A Gulf of Mexico case study illustrates how this map migration technique simplifies the time structure map and explains anomalous amplitude variations.",10.1190/1.1443668
Display Of Archaeological Magnetic Data,"Magnetic data from archaeological sites have traditionally been displayed by contour, isometric, and dot‐density plotting, or by simulated gray‐scale techniques using symbol overprinting. These methods do not show fine linear structures in the data which are of great interest to archaeologists. If true gray‐scale methods using a modern video display, followed by film recording for hard copy are employed, image processing techniques can be applied to enhance the geometric structures of archaeological interest. Interpolation techniques for enlarging data to full screen size, along with compression methods to keep data within gray‐scale capabilities, are needed. Such techniques would introduce minimum distortion and allow faint details to be seen in the vicinity of strong anomalies. Postprocessing methods based on rapid image spatial filtering and enhancement algorithms could then be applied in an interactive environment.",10.1190/1.1442116
Approximation To The Lateral Variation Of Residual Gravity Due To A Frustum Of A Vertical Cone,"The equation for the subject title is presented in nondimensional form. The approximation consists of considering a frustum of a vertical cone in which the radii are small relative to the depth to its top. The dependent variable has been taken as being the ratio of the residual gravity (as defined in a previous publication by the author) to the maximum residual gravity. The independent variable was chosen as the ratio of the lateral distance (from the center line of the frustum to a given station) to the depth to the top of the frustum. The two parameters were chosen as being (a) The ratio of depth to the bottom of the frustum to that to its top, (b) The ratio of the bottom radius to that of the top radius. It is then shown that, for special values of the parameters, the equation gives the lateral variation of residual gravity due to cylinders, upright cones, and inverted cones as special cases. Tables of the principal functions, which occur in the equation, are given over practical ranges of values. Graphs of the equation are given. They cover the practical range for each of the variables and each of the parameters. Application of the equation is made to two Gulf Coast salt domes whose dimensions are rather well known from previous drilling. Graphs, showing the degree of correlation, are given. The conclusion is drawn that, despite the approximation involved in the derivation of the equation, and despite the departure of the ratio of the dimensions of the salt domes from that assumed, the correlation with the actual gravity values for two deep salt domes is remarkably close.",10.1190/1.1437891
A Conducting Sphere In A Time Varying Magnetic Field,The secondary magnetic fields are evaluated for the case of a conducting sphere in a relatively poorly conducting medium under the influence of a time varying magnetic field. The sinusoidal and step function responses are both considered. The responses so calculated are thought to be useful in a geophysical prospecting method which utilizes the transient behavior of induced eddy currents in a highly conducting ore zone.,10.1190/1.1437716
Mixed‐Delay Wavelet Deconvolution Of The Point‐Source Seismogram,"The problem of extracting a mixed‐delay source wavelet from a point‐source seismogram for an acoustic, horizontally stratified medium (bounded by a free surface above and a half‐space below or between two half‐spaces) can be completely solved without any further assumptions about the source pulse or the model parameters. The solution relies on information contained in the so‐called evanescent part of the point‐source seismogram, which can be extracted via a plane‐wave decomposition, i.e., by a transformation of the point‐source seismogram from the time‐space domain into the frequency‐rayparameter domain.",10.1190/1.1443160
The Electrical Field In A Borehole With A Casing,"The electric field on the borehole axis in the presence of a casing can be divided into three zones: the near, intermediate, and far zones. Within the intermediate zone, determination of the second derivative of the potential allows me to define the formation resistivity. Outside the casing, the electric field, at large distances from the borehole, has a radial direction that provides a sufficient depth of investigation in this direction. The measurement requires knowledge of the casing conductance. Application of transmission line theory is based on the fact that the electric field in the formation is radial within the intermediate zone, resulting in the conclusion that the vertical resolution of such a measurement would depend only upon the spacing of the electrodes required to estimate the second derivative of the potential.",10.1190/1.1442769
Magnetic Interpretation Of Semi‐Infinite Sheet‐Like Bodies,"Interpretation of magnetic anomalies generated by thin sheets has attracted the attention of several authors and many papers describing diversified interpretation techniques have appeared in geophysical literature. In the present note, the same problem is viewed from a different angle, and three simple and direct methods of determining the depth and direction of magnetization due to thin sheets, are presented. Their relative merits, together with application in two examples for testing their validity, are given.",10.1190/1.1440112
The L/M Parameter Of Time‐Domain Ip Measurements—A Computational Analysis,"The L/M parameter measured in some time‐domain IP systems has been analyzed theoretically by calculating the behavior of this parameter as a funcfion of intrinsic IP response and homogeneous earth EM coupling response. Calculated time‐domain voltage waveforms exhibit graphically the presence of (1) intrinsic IP response, (2) positive EM coupling response, and (3) negative EM coupling response. Quantitatively, L/M remains constant at unity for varying values of intrinsic IP response, and an anomalous L/M value indicates the presence of coupling.",10.1190/1.1440334
Radiation Resistance Of A Vertical Magnetic Dipole Over An Inhomogeneous Earth,"The expressions for the energy radiated per second from an oscillating vertical magnetic dipole situated above a two‐layer earth are derived. Of the three important cases to which particular attention has been given, the first and the second involve the presence of a conducting and insulating substratum, respectively. The third deals with a dipole placed over a thin conducting sheet of infinite extent. Appropriate approximations have been made such that the results may be useful for geoelectrical exploration.",10.1190/1.1438927
Stable Inversion-Based Multitrace Deabsorption Method For Spatial Continuity Preservation And Weak Signal Compensation,"Nonstationary seismic data can be expressed using a linear matrix-vector multiplication system derived from wave theory when anelastic effects of the earth can be quantified by the intrinsic quality factor (or Q) and Q is frequency independent in the seismic bandwidth. On the basis of the linear modeling system and singular value decomposition, we have assessed the stability using weights associated with the left singular vectors, data, and singular values, and we assessed the compensation/resolution limitation of inversion-based deabsorption using the right singular vectors. In addition, a stable inversion-based multitrace deabsorption method was developed by minimizing the l1-norm of coefficients in the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain of reflectivity subject to the time-domain nonstationary data misfit. The optimum deabsorption result can be obtained by sequentially solving a series of lasso subproblems until the stopping condition is reached. As the number of solving lasso subproblems increases, the role of f-k magnitude sparsity constraint relative to data misfit gradually decreases. In this way, the proposed method can highlight the spatial continuities and reduce the influence of noise on the updated result during starting iterations due to f-k magnitude sparsity, whereas compensate details including some discontinuities of events and weak reflections during later iterations due to the dominant role of data misfit. We tested the method on a series of data sets, including a synthetic data set, a physical modeling data set, and a field data set. Our results determined that the proposed method can provide stable compensation results, even in the presence of coherent noise and/or strong random noise. Compared with the trace-by-trace l1-norm regularization deabsorption method, our method performed better in spatial continuity preservation and weak signal compensation.",10.1190/geo2015-0247.1
Irregular Magnetic Activity In Northern Canada With Special Reference To Aeromagnetic Survey Problems,"An investigation of the diurnal and seasonal characteristics of irregular magnetic activity in northern Canada, using two indices of disturbance, shows that in general the K index provides a reliable but smoothed measure of short period activity. Two peaks of activity are evident, a day‐time peak, dominant inside the polar cap, and a night peak, dominant south of the auroral zone. The latter occurs within one hour of local geomagnetic midnight at four Canadian observatories, whereas the day‐time peak occurs progressively later at higher latitudes. The maximum activity occurs in the equinoxes at latitudes near the auroral zone, and during the summer solstice at very high latitudes. Measurements of range at the most disturbed observatory suggest that aeromagnetic surveying in high latitudes is in general feasible, but that for accurate reconnaissance work it is very advantageous to plan operations, so far as conditions permit, taking account of the systematic diurnal variation of disturbance. It is shown that errors of about one half the assumed diurnal change between base lines will occur and sufficient data is given to allow approximate predictions of the optimum length of flight lines.",10.1190/1.1438400
Time-Series Analysis Of Diffusion Interferometry Data And Its Application To Bayesian Inversion Of Synthetic Borehole Pressure Data,"Interferometry methods in exploration geophysics are premised on a powerful theoretical foundation in which the ambient noise observed at discrete locations can be manipulated through either crosscorrelation or convolution to yield the response of a virtual ""active source"" experiment (i.e., the empirical Green's function, abbreviated as EGF) without the actual deployment of physical sources. Sources of the ambient background may be either naturally occurring or engineered. Regardless, the theory for diffusive systems requires them to be volumetrically distributed over an infinite domain. The central question is then, ""What region for the ambient sources matters most for good EGF estimation?"" Here, we build on previous work in frequency domain EGF estimation by extending the analysis to the time domain where the broadband response is driven by the continuum of diffusive length scales therein. Analysis of the double half-space diffusion model (simulating a lithologic contact) demonstrates that sources between the two receiver locations have the most impact on EGF accuracy, and that when either of the receivers is close to the lithologic contact, the sources must also extend more deeply, into the high-diffusivity side to maintain accuracy. We further examine the suitability for inversion of EGF signals built with the limited and finite ambient source distributions expected in actual exploration scenarios. One-dimensional Bayesian inversion of singlewell and crosswell configurations of a three-layered system simulating a reservoir layer between two impermeable layers revealed that transient EGF signals were reliably invertible when sources were constrained to the middle reservoir layer. In production monitoring settings, natural sources originating from pumping and subsequent flow-related physics (pressure diffusion, electrochemical and seismoelectric effects, etc.), this result suggests that EGF signals may be a useful measure of reservoir properties.",10.1190/geo2013-0113.1
Stress‐Dependent Seismic Anisotropy Of Shales,"A simple theory for the stress‐dependent seismic anisotropy of shales can be obtained in terms of a second‐rank tensor and a fourth‐rank tensor that depend on the orientation distribution of contacts between clay platelets. The theory allows the normal and shear stiffness of the contact regions between clay platelets to be obtained as a function of stress from measurements of seismic P- and S-wave velocities for shales. The ratio of the normal‐to‐shear compliance, BN/BT, of the contact regions between clay particles is found to be sensitive to the saturation state of the shale. Inversion of velocity measurements for fully saturated shales shows a low value of BN/BT when compared with measurements on air‐dry shales, consistent with the expected reduction in normal compliance in a fluid‐saturated, low‐permeability rock. For all shales considered, BN/BT is found to be less than unity. The contacts between clay particles are therefore more compliant in shear than in compression.",10.1190/1.1444535
"Progressing From 1D To 2D And 3D Near-Surface Airborne Electromagnetic Mapping With A Multisensor, Airborne Sea-Ice Explorer","The polar ocean's sea ice cover is an unconventional and challenging geophysical target. Helicopter electromagnetic (HEM) sea-ice thickness mapping is currently limited to 1D interpretation due to traditional procedures and systems. These systems are mainly sensitive to layered structures, ideally set for the widespread flat (level) ice type. Because deformed sea ice (e.g., pressure ridges) is 3D and usually also heterogeneous, ice thickness errors up to 50% can be observed for pressure ridges using 1D approximations for the interpretation of HEM data. We researched a new generation multisensor, airborne sea ice explorer (MAiSIE) to overcome these limitations. Three-dimensional finite-element modeling enabled us to determine that more than one frequency is needed, ideally in the range 1–8 kHz, to improve thickness estimates of grounded sea-ice pressure ridges that are typical of 3D sea ice structures. With the MAiSIE system, we found a new electromagnetic concept based on one multifrequency transmitter loop and a 3C receiver coil triplet with active digital bucking. The relatively small weight of the EM components freed enough payload to include additional scientific sensors, including a cross-track lidar scanner and high-accuracy inertial-navigation system combined with dual-antenna differential GPS. Integrating the 3D ice-surface topography obtained from the lidar with the EM data at frequencies from 500 Hz to 8 kHz in x-, y-, and z-directions, significantly increased the accuracy of sea-ice pressure-ridge geometry derived from HEM data. Initial test flight results over open water showed the proof-of-concept with acceptable sensor drift and receiver sensitivity. Noise levels were relatively high (20–250 parts-per-million) due to unwanted interference, leaving room for optimization. The 20 ppm noise level at 4.1 kHz is sufficient to map level ice thickness with 10 cm precision for sensor altitudes below 13 m.",10.1190/geo2011-0375.1
Focusing The Wavefield Inside An Unknown 1D Medium: Beyond Seismic Interferometry,"With seismic interferometry one can retrieve the response to a virtual source inside an unknown medium, if there is a receiver at the position of the virtual source. Using inverse scattering theory, we demonstrate that, for a 1D medium, the requirement of having an actual receiver inside the medium can be circumvented, going beyond seismic interferometry. In this case, the wavefield can be focused inside an unknown medium with independent variations in velocity and density using reflection data only.",10.1190/geo2012-0060.1
"Reflection Moveout Inversion For Horizontal Transverse Isotropy: Accuracy, Limitation, And Acquisition","Horizontal transverse isotropy (HTI) is the simplest azimuthally anisotropic model used to describe vertical fracturing in an isotropic matrix. Assuming that the subsurface is laterally homogeneous, and using the elliptical variation of P-wave NMO velocity with azimuth measured in at least three different source‐to‐receiver orientations, we can estimate three key parameters of HTI media: the vertical velocity, anisotropy, and the azimuth of the symmetry axis. Such parameter estimation is sensitive to the angular separation between the survey lines in 2-D acquisition or, equivalently, to source‐to‐receiver azimuths in 3-D acquisition and the set of azimuths used in the inversion procedure. The accuracy in estimating the azimuth, in particular, is also sensitive to the strength of anisotropy, while the accuracy in resolving vertical velocity and anisotropy is about the same for any strength of anisotropy. To maximize the accuracy and stability in parameter estimation, it is best to have the azimuths for the source‐to‐receiver directions 60° apart when only three directions are used. This requirement is feasible in land seismic data acquisition where wide azimuthal coverage can be designed. In marine streamer acquisition, however, the azimuthal data coverage is limited. Multiple survey directions are necessary to achieve such wide azimuthal coverage in streamer surveys. To perform the inversion using three azimuth directions, 60° apart, an HTI layer overlain by an azimuthally isotropic overburden should have a time thickness, relative to the total time, of at least the ratio of the error in the NMO (stacking) velocity to the interval anisotropy strength of the HTI layer. Having more than three source‐to‐receiver azimuths (e.g., full azimuthal coverage), however, provides a useful data redundancy that enhances the quality of the estimates, thus allowing acceptable parameter estimation at smaller relative thicknesses.",10.1190/1.1444713
Evaluation Of New Geophysical Methods,"Last March when you did me the honor of selecting me as President, I hoped I would have the privilege in my Presidential Address of telling part of the story of the contributions of geophysicists to the war effort, and of attempting some prophecies concerning the contributions of the war to geophysicists' future prospecting efforts. For a time last fall, official optimism reached the point where it seemed that it would be possible to secure the release of some of the story; however, in December, I realized that someone else would have that pleasure. But, in looking forward to the day when we can turn away from our wartime activities, I have had my interest rekindled in an old problem, a problem which, with our present prospecting organizations, is the mutual responsibility of geophysicists, geologists and management. It is the problem of evaluating proposed new geophysical prospecting procedures and the somewhat simpler but still extremely difficult problem of evaluating modifications of existing methods.",10.1190/1.1437172
"Correlation Of Gravity Observations With The Geology Of The Coal Creek Serpentine Mass, Blanco And Gillespie Counties, Texas","Gravitational observations were made of the pre‐Cambrian Coal Creek serpentine mass in Blanco and Gillespie Counties, Texas, the geology of which had been mapped previously. The observed gravitational anomalies indicate roughly the depth of the serpentine mass below which it may possibly grade into its parent peridotitic rock. Probable correlation between the gravitational map and the other geologic features of the area is indicated.",10.1190/1.1437529
Magnetic Relaxation And The Electromagnetic Response Parameter,"Relaxation processes are important in the study of electromagnetic prospecting techniques. These processes can be the result of magnetic fields due to eddy currents in electrical conductors or due to displacement currents from dielectric processes or magnetic fields associated with direct magnetic loss phenomena. In the past, most attention has been focused on eddy‐current losses since this is the dominant effect. Dielectric losses also may be of importance, particularly at high frequencies, where the conductivity is extremely low or where the dielectric properties become anomalously high. In general, however, little attention has been given to magnetic losses and the effect they might have on the electromagnetic response parameter. Magnetic minerals do have a measurable magnetic loss due to various mechanisms. This effect has been measured in a frequency range from 125 to 5000 hz for a variety of samples. In synthetic samples with varying amounts of magnetite dispersed in a nonmagnetic matrix the effect is linearly proportional to the magnetite content. The magnetic loss causes a distinct, but small, change in the electromagnetic response of a body. The effect can be detected, provided the peak frequency of magnetic loss is lower than the peak frequency of electrical loss. The most diagnostic feature is the reversed phase relationship from the electrical response (for constant geometries).",10.1190/1.1440429
Exact Green'S Functions Using Leaking Modes For Axisymmetric Boreholes In Solid Elastic Media,"By choosing appropriate paths of integration in both the complex frequency ω and complex wavenumber k planes, exact Green's functions for elastic wave propagation in axisymmetric fluid‐filled boreholes in solid elastic media are expressed completely as sums of modes. There are no contributions from branch line integrals. The integrations with respect to k are performed exactly using Cauchy residue theory. The remaining integrations with respect to ω are then carried out partly by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and partly by using another numerical method. Provided that the number of points in the FFT can be taken sufficiently large, there are no restrictions on distance. The method is fast, accurate, and easy to apply.",10.1190/1.1442688
Seismic Depth Imaging Of Normal Faulting In The Southern Death Valley Basin,"Motivated by the need to image faults to test Cenozoic extension models for the Death Valley region of the western basin and range province, an area of strong lateral velocity variations, we examine the geometry of normal faulting in southern Death Valley by seismic depth imaging. We analyze COCORP Death Valley Line 9 to attain an enhanced image of shallow fault structure to 2.5 km depth. Previous work used standard seismic processing to infer normal faults from bed truncations, displacement of horizontal reflectors, and diffractions. We obtain a detailed velocity model by nonlinear optimization of first‐ arrival times picked from shot gathers, examine the unprocessed data for fault reflections, and use a Kirchhoff prestack depth imaging procedure to handle lateral velocity variations and arbitrary dips properly. Fault‐plane reflections reveal the listric true‐depth geometry of the normal fault at the Black Mountains range front in southern Death Valley. This is consistent with the concept of low‐angle extension in this region and strengthens its association with crustal‐scale magmatic plumbing.",10.1190/1.1444316
Imaging Diffractors Using Wave-Equation Migration,"We have developed a fast and practical wave-equation-based migration method to image subsurface diffractors. The method is composed of three steps in our implementation. First, it decomposes extrapolated receiver wavefields at every imaging point into local plane waves by a linear Radon transform; the transform is realized by a novel computationally efficient recursive algorithm. Second, the decomposed plane waves are zero lag-correlated with the incident source wavefields, where the incident angles are computed via the structure tensor approach. The resulting prestack images are binned into dip-angle gathers according to the directions of the decomposed plane waves and the calculated incident angles. Third, a windowed median filter is applied to the dip-angle gathers to suppress the focused reflection energy, and it produces the desired diffraction images. This method is tested on synthetic and field data. The results demonstrate that it is resistant to random noise, computationally efficient, and applicable to field data in practice. The results also indicate that the diffraction images are able to provide important discontinuous geologic features, such as scattering and faulting zones, and thus are helpful for seismic interpretation.",10.1190/geo2016-0029.1
"""Optimum Offset"" Seismic Reflection Mapping Of Shallow Aquifers Near Bangkok, Thailand","The ""optimum offset"" shallow seismic reflection technique was developed for geotechnical and groundwater applications in the early 1980s. The method was based on equipment that was ""state of the art"" at the time: a 10-bit engineering seismograph, a simple inhole shotgun source, and Apple II personal computers for data processing. In 1985 and 1986, this technique was successfully used in Thailand to assist in understanding the land subsidence problem around Bangkok, which is directly attributable to excessive groundwater withdrawal. The seismic sections acquired in this study were used to map subsurface structure to a depth of about 180 m, which includes several major aquifers beneath the Bangkok Clay. Much of Bangkok's domestic water is pumped from the so‐called ""second aquifer,"" 80–130 m below surface, which proved to be an excellent seismic marker horizon showing lateral continuity over distances on the order of kilometers. This observation suggests that there may be good hydraulic connection within this aquifer over large areas. While the technique and equipment used in this study are dated now, the results provide a valuable demonstration of the application of inexpensive shallow reflection methods to a major engineering and groundwater problem that is of concern in many urban centers around the world. It is presented here for its societal relevance in this regard and for its historical aspect as perhaps the first application of shallow seismic reflection profiling in Southeast Asia.",10.1190/1.1444440
"History Of The Geophysical Exploration Of The Cameron Meadows Dome, Cameron Parish, Louisiana","In order to demonstrate the growth of our knowledge of a typical Gulf Coast salt dome concurrently with development of the science of geophysics, the successive application of various techniques to the exploration of the Cameron Meadows dome is described and illustrated. These methods were: mechanical refraction seismograph (1926); torsion balance (1927); electrical refraction seismograph (1928–29); early correlation reflection seismograph (1929); dip reflection seismograph (1933); special salt profiling refraction seismograph (1942); continuous correlation reflection seismograph (1942); gravity meter (1943.)",10.1190/1.1437144
Amplitude Preservation Of Radon-Based Multiple-Removal Filters,"This study examines the effect of filtering in the Radon transform domain on reflection amplitudes. Radon filters are often used for removal of multiple reflections from normal moveout-corrected seismic data. The unweighted solution to the Radon transform reduces reflection amplitudes at both near and far offsets due to a truncation effect. However, the weighted solutions to the transform produce localized events in the transform domain, which minimizes this truncation effect. Synthetic examples suggest that filters designed in the Radon domain based on a weighted solution to the linear, parabolic, or hyperbolic transforms preserve the near- and far-offset reflection amplitudes while removing the multiples; whereas the unweighted solutions diminish reflection amplitudes which may distort subsequent amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) analysis.",10.1190/1.2243711
Straight-Rays Redatuming: A Fast And Robust Alternative To Wave-Equation-Based Datuming,"Wave-equation-based redatuming is expensive and requires a detailed knowledge of the shallow velocity field. We derive the analytical expression of a new prestack wavefield extrapolation operator, the Topographic Datuming Operator (TDO), which applies redatuming based on straight-rays approximation above and below a chosen datum. This redatuming operator is directly applied to common-source gathers to downward continue the source and the receivers, simultaneously, to the datum level without resorting to common-receiver gathers. As a result, the method is far more efficient and robust than the conventional wave-equation-based redatuming and does not require an accurate depth-domain interval velocity model. In addition, TDO, unlike wave-equation-based redatuming, requires effective velocities above datum, and thus can be applied using attributes valid for static correction methods. Effective velocities beneath the datum permit us to replace the surface integral, which is needed for wave-equation redatuming with a line integral. In the particular case of infinite (in practice, very high with respect to the shallow layers) velocity beneath the datum, the TDO impulse response collapses to a point, and TDO redatuming is equivalent to conventional static correction, which may, therefore, be regarded as a special case of the newly derived operator. The computational cost of applying TDO is slightly larger than static corrections, yet provides higher quality results partially attributable to the ability of TDO to suppress diffractions emanating from anomalies above datum. Since TDO is an operation based on geometrical optics approximation, velocity after TDO is not biased by the vertical shift correction associated with conventional static correction. Application to a synthetic data set demonstrates the features of the method.",10.1190/1.2196032
Static Image Principle For Anisotropic‐Conducting Half‐Space Problems: Pec And Pmc Boundaries,"The image principle for an isotropic half‐space bounded by perfect electric conductor (PEC) or perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) plane is presented in most elementary textbooks on electromagnetics. It is perhaps not so well known that this principle can also be generalized to anisotropic media in the static case, because it is not covered in leading monographs of geoelectromagnetics (Wait, 1982; Negi and Saraf, 1989; Eskola, 1992). The anisotropic image method can be applied to geologic media that exhibit anisotropic electrical conductivity caused by the fractures and fissures in the rock. Such structures are important in the sites for disposal of nuclear waste. The characterization of these structures by electrical geophysical methods is very essential because they form the main paths for groundwater flow. The air‐ground boundary can be treated as a PMC plane representing the nonconducting medium. Otherwise the medium is assumed to be linear (ohmic) and homogeneous in terms of electrical conductivity. The image method presented is also relevant to problems arising in the traditional ore prospecting where a conducting ore body buried in an electrically anisotropic host rock generates secondary electric fields (Asten, 1974; Eloranta, 1988).",10.1190/1.1443401
Interferometric Correlogram-Space Analysis,"Controlled-source seismic interferometry is a method of obtaining a virtual shot gather from a collection of physical shot gathers. The set of traces corresponding to two common receiver gathers from many physical shots is used to synthesize a virtual shot located at one of the receivers and a receiver at the other. An estimate of the Green's function between these two receivers is obtained by first crosscorrelating corresponding pairs of traces from each of the shots and then stacking the resulting crosscorrelograms. We studied the structure of crosscorrelograms obtained from a VSP acquisition geometry using surface sources and downhole receivers. The model is purely acoustic and contains flat or dipping layers and/or point inclusions that act as diffractors. We propose a semblance analysis based on moveout curves for both point diffractors and flat or dipping layers, which can be used to improve the quality of redatumed traces either by rejecting certain events prior to stacking or by enhancing them.",10.1190/1.3519875
Noise Attenuation On Common‐Depth‐Point Seismic Records By A Semideterministic Approach,"A simple seismic record synthesis for common‐depth‐point data was examined for analytic representation in terms of its harmonic spectrum. This frequency‐domain investigation revealed that the primary‐reflection signal can be completely recovered in the absence of random noise, or it can be better recovered in the presence of random noise than normal stacking affords, especially, if the coherent‐noise‐to‐random‐noise ratio is high. The success of this technique is founded upon the principle that difference equations in the time domain become algebraic equations in the frequency domain. The technique is partially ""probabilistic"" because analytic solutions for the primary‐reflection signal are stacked for further attenuation of noise. The constituents of the seismic records, after static and normal‐moveout corrections, are: identical, coincident, primary‐reflection signal; identical, time‐shifted coherent noise; and random noise. The coherent‐noise time shifts must be determined for application of the semideterministic technique; methods are discussed in the Data Processing section.",10.1190/1.1439967
On The Relationship Between Induced Polarization And Surface Conductivity: Implications For Petrophysical Interpretation Of Electrical Measurements,"Petrophysical interpretation of resistivity measurements is often hindered by the dependence of resistivity on the interconnected pore fluids and the interconnected pore surfaces. Induced polarization (IP) measurements yield parameters that are only controlled by the interconnected pore surfaces, thereby offering the opportunity to constrain interpretation of resistivity measurements. Using a database composed of 63 sandstone and unconsolidated sediment samples covering nine independent investigations, we identified a strong linear relationship between the real part of surface conductivity (σsurf′) determined from multisalinity (σw) resistivity measurements and the imaginary conductivity (σ″) measured with IP at a frequency of about 1 Hz. We found σ″/σsurf′=l=0.042 with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.911 and a standard deviation of l of 0.022. We found a similar relation when the normalized chargeability (from Debye decomposition) of the frequency dependence of the IP response is used instead of σ′. By estimating the true formation factor (F) recorded at high salinity, we solved for σsurf′(σw) and found that it parallels the salinity dependency of the imaginary conductivity, σ″(σw), as reported in recent studies. We also found that the value of the l determined from this experimental study was generally consistent with predictions of the POLARIS model when the mobility of the ions in the Stern layer was assumed to be 1/350 of the mobility of the ions in the diffuse layer (considered equal to the mobility of the ions in the bulk solution). We discovered how the identified relationship can be used to significantly improve (1) the estimation of the true formation factor and (2) the groundwater conductivity, from a single salinity resistivity measurement when an IP measurement is also made. The approach offers an opportunity to improve estimation of porosity, formation factor, and salinity in well logging and hydrogeophysical investigations.",10.1190/geo2013-0076.1
Shot-Gather Time Migration Of Planar Reflectors Without Velocity Model,"Standard migration techniques require a velocity model. A new and fast prestack time migration method is presented that does not require a velocity model as an input. The only input is a shot gather, unlike other velocity-independent migrations that also require input of data in other gathers. The output of the presented migration is a time-migrated image and the migration velocity model. The method uses the first and second derivatives of the traveltimes with respect to the location of the receiver. These attributes are estimated by computing the gradient of the amplitude in a shot gather. The assumptions of the approach are a laterally slowly changing velocity and reflectors with small curvatures; the dip of the reflector can be arbitrary. The migration velocity corresponds to the root mean square (rms) velocity for laterally homogeneous media for near offsets. The migration expressions for 2D and 3D cases are derived from a simple geometrical construction considering the image of the source. The strengths and weaknesses of the methods are demonstrated on synthetic data. At last, the applicability of the method is discussed by interpreting the migration velocity in terms of the Taylor expansion of the traveltime around the zero offset.",10.1190/1.3549641
Algorithms For Least‐Squares Linear Prediction And Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis—Part I: Theory,"Experience with the maximum entropy spectral analysis (MESA) method suggests that (1) it can produce inaccurate frequency estimates of short sample sinusoidal data, and (2) it sometimes produces calculated values for the filter coefficients that are unduly contaminated by rounding errors. Consequently, in this report we develop an algorithm for solving the underlying least‐squares linear prediction (LSLP) problem directly, without forcing a Toeplitz structure on the model. This approach leads to more accurate frequency determination for short sample harmonic processes, and our algorithm is computationally efficient and numerically stable. The algorithm can also be applied to two other versions of the linear prediction problem. A Fortran program is given in Part II.",10.1190/1.1441091
Exact Inversion Of Plane‐Layered Isotropic And Anisotropic Elastic Media By The State‐Space Approach,"Time‐domain state‐space inversion methods for non‐dispersive layered media have shown that acoustic impedance as a function of traveltime can be determined from a normally incident, plane, pressure‐wave source. The state‐space method is used here to determine the density and acoustic velocity separately as functions of depth by simultaneously inverting surface data measured at two precritical angles of incidence. The acoustic state‐space method is also applied to isotropic elastic media with normally incident P-waves and obliquely incident SH-wave sources, whereby the density, shear velocity, and compressional velocity are determined as functions of depth. The same parameters are recovered by modifying Shiva and Mendel's (1983) method for a single, obliquely incident P-wave source to accommodate a single SV-wave source, two P-wave sources, or data obtained from a previous (scalar) SH-wave inversion. Using data from multiple experiments eliminates nonuniqueness in the inversion procedure. We have extended the state‐space approach to generally anisotropic media to solve for the layer thicknesses, densities, elastic stiffness parameters, and symmetry axis rotation angles in each layer. Three‐component recording is required to identify the wave types at each interface and to downward continue the wave fields properly at depth. For transverse isotropy and all higher anisotropies, an n-parameter search is required at each interface, where 1 ⩽ n ⩽ 25. This adds an inherent nonuniqueness to the inversion. However, for transverse isotropy, nonuniqueness does not appear to be a serious problem since the layer parameters are determined by a single‐parameter search of a monotonic function at each interface. It appears that slant stacking of multicomponent surface seismograms is applicable to generally anisotropic media and that methods that deal with noise and band limitations in acoustic media can be useful to anisotropic inversion as well.",10.1190/1.1442059
Iron Oxides As A Cause Of Gpr Reflections,"Iron oxides frequently occur as secondary precipitates in both modern and ancient sediments and may form bands or irregular patterns. We show from time-domain reflectometry (TDR) field studies that goethite iron-oxide precipitates significantly lower the electromagnetic wave velocity of sediments. Measured variations in magnetic permeability do not explain this decrease. The TDR measurements and a dielectric mixing model also show that neither electrical conductivity nor relative permittivity of the solid material are altered significantly by the iron-oxide material. From drying during all of the measurements, the amount of iron oxides appears to correlate with the volumetric water content, which is the result of differences in water retention capacity between goethite and quartz. These variations in water content control relative permittivity and explain the observed variation in electromagnetic wave velocity. Using 2-D synthetic radar sections, we show that the pattern of iron-oxide precipitation may have a profound influence on the GPR reflection configuration and can cause major difficulties in interpretation.",10.1190/1.1468614
A Simple Method For Decomposing Fracture‐Induced Anisotropy,"A heterogeneous mixture of isotropic elements may appear homogeneous and anisotropic when the scale of its fabric is smaller than the seismic wavelengths that measure it (Backus, 1962). These fabrics can result from thin layering or from oriented microcracks or fractures. In many situations the anisotropy is quite complex, resulting, for example, from fractures in previously anisotropic media. Since these anisotropies combine, the effect of each must be separated to permit the study of either the fractures or the preexisting anisotropy.",10.1190/1.1443149
Prestack Depth Migration Of An Alberta Foothills Data Set—The Husky Experience,"We produce depth images for an Alberta Foothills line by iteratively using a number of migration and velocity analysis techniques. In imaging steeply dipping layers of a foothills data set, it is apparent that thrust belt geology can violate the conventional assumptions of elevation datum corrections and common midpoint (CMP) stacking. To circumvent these problems, we use migration from topography in which we perform prestack depth migration on the data using correct source and receiver elevations. Migration from topography produces enhanced images of steep shallow reflectors when compared to conventional processing. In addition to migration from topography, we couple prestack depth migration with the continuous adjustment of velocity depth models. A number of criteria are used in doing this. These criteria require that our velocity estimates produce a focused image and that migrated depths in common image gathers be independent of source‐receiver offset. Velocity models are estimated by a series of iterative and interpretive steps involving prestack migration velocity analysis and structural interpretation. Overlays of velocity models on depth migrations should generally show consistency between velocity boundaries and reflection depths. Our preferred seismic depth section has been produced by using prestack reverse‐time depth migration coupled with careful geological interpretation.",10.1190/1.1444338

Magnetic And Telluric Current Disturbances In Alaska,"Much of Alaska lies in or near the auroral zone, where magnetic and telluric current disturbances are large compared to those at lower geomagnetic latitudes. Pronounced and different diurnal variations of disturbance are evident from analysis of K indices from Barrow, College, and Sitka magnetic observatories. The quietest period for magnetic or electrical surveying is the late morning and afternoon hours locally. Recordings of telluric current disturbances can be used as a sensitive indicator of ionospheric activity. The large amplitude and rich frequency spectrum of the telluric currents suggests their use as a prospecting tool in Alaska.",10.1190/1.1438813
Multidimensional Inversion Of Loop-Loop Frequency-Domain Em Data For Resistivity And Magnetic Susceptibility,"Electromagnetic (EM) induction measurements are affected by resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. Thus, inverting EM data for resistivity alone can give misleading models if susceptible effects are strong. An inversion algorithm is presented to simultaneously recover multidimensional distributions of resistivity and susceptibility from various types of loop-loop frequency-domain EM data. The algorithm adopts a staggered-grid finite-difference method for the 3D forward solutions and computes the sensitivities with respect to resistivity and susceptibility from the forward solutions using the reciprocity principle. The algorithm is tested on synthetic data sets from ground-based small-loop, airborne, and Slingram EM surveys. It is shown that the simultaneous inversion of the small-loop EM data collected at a singleheight is unstable and likely to produce unreliable susceptibility models because the effect of susceptibility is nearly independent of the frequency. However, if the data are obtained for multiple heights or different loop configurations, simultaneous inversion can produce more reliable susceptibility and resistivity models even if the data are contaminated by offset errors. It is also shown that although the simultaneous inversion of airborne EM data is relatively stable, adding data obtained at different heights helps to increase the reliability of the resistivity and susceptibility models. Among the loop-loop EM methods discussed here, the Slingram method is relatively insensitive to susceptibility anomalies and thus cannot be used to recover the susceptibility distribution via inversion even if the data are obtained using different loop configurations.",10.1190/1.3503652
A Simple Parametric Model For The Electromagnetic Response Of An Anomalous Body In A Host Medium,"A simple approximate representation of the spectral response of an arbitrary kind of electromagnetic (EM) prospecting system to a small conductive target in a conductive environment has been derived. The representation contains the direct response from the layered host medium and the first‐order effects of eddy current induction, current channeling, magnetic induction, and the coupling between eddy current and magnetic inductions in the anomalous body, as modified by the host medium. The only significant computational task in the representation is evaluation of a few Green's functions for the host medium. As a guide to establishing proper approximations, a fundamental study of integral equations is presented. Very simple solutions for the secondary or scattering sources which represent the EM effect of the body are obtained for a few basic cases. Equations for more general cases are complicated by additional terms in the Green's functions which represent ac interaction between scattering sources and the host medium, the effects of layering in the host, or interactions between the different types of scattering sources. Through a supplementary study of the response of a conductive disk embedded in a conductive host to an axisymmetric field, the ac interaction between the host medium and scattering sources in the disk is shown to be relatively unimportant. Hence, interaction with layering in the host is also minimal. Green's functions in the integral equation can consequently be simplified. The representation as a whole has been tested by comparing its predictions of the spectral form of a response with two published data sets, responses of a plate model in a conductive host. The fits for targets of moderate and large size, relative to the scale of the particular experiment, range from excellent to good qualitative resemblance. The representation should find application in making expensive numerical or analog model studies more useful and understandable to the field geophysicist, in converting real and model data between the time‐ and frequency‐domain formats, in constructing practical inverse algorithms, and in predicting the form of EM effects in induced polarization and magnetometric resistivity surveys.",10.1190/1.1441883
Spectrum Of The Potential Field Due To Randomly Distributed Sources,"Covariance and spectral density functions of all three components of random potential fields are mutually related. The spectra of any one component on two different levels are related through an exponential function of the separation of the levels. If, starting from the earth's surface, we continue the observed random field downward, we find that at a certain level the field becomes unstable. Such a limiting depth can be estimated from the spectrum of the observed field. The spectrum of the random field is related to the spectrum of random density or intensity of magnetization. The random sources are assumed to be confined to a thin sheet or a thick, infinite sheet, or to a semi‐infinite medium. In all these cases, a relation connecting the spectrum of the random density or the intensity of magnetization and the spectrum of the random field has been established.",10.1190/1.1439933
"Deep Subpermafrost Thermal Regime In The Mackenzie Delta Basin, Northern Canada—Analysis From Petroleum Bottom‐Hole Temperature Data","In our studies of the thermal regime of sediments of the young Mackenzie Delta in the southeastern part of the Beaufort-Mackenzie basin of northern Canada, we used thermal data from the base of the permafrost layer, together with temperature data from petroleum wells. By analyzing bottom-hole temperature (BHT) data, we found that the percentage correction, i.e., the percentage difference between BHT and equilibrium temperature, is less than 10% ((with 67% probability) for times exceeding 10 hours after circulation ended, regardless of circulation time. No correlation exists between the percentage correction and depths for the BHT data. Theoretical temperature-depth profiles were constructed from the individual heat flow Q, Q +δQ, and Q-δQ values (δQ is error of estimate of Q), the interval thermal conductivities, and a permafrost base temperature of 0°C. Estimates of Q were based on the maximum BHTs from depths 2.7 km. The measured and corrected BHT values for depths less than 1.5 km lie outside the range defined by the predicted temperature and temperature at the base of permafrost. Therefore, the temperature gradient based on interval‐temperature difference between deep and shallow BHTs or ground‐surface temperature and shallow BHTs may not represent the thermal field accurately within the sedimentary strata. The temperature data from the maximum depths, the permafrost base temperature of 0 °C from the 10 deep wells, and estimated thermal conductivities for the sedimentary column give an average heat flow Q¯ of 51±6mWm-2 (error of estimate of the individual Q value, δQ=±11), which is comparable to the values found in the region of the Canada basin.",10.1190/1.1442844
Some Effects Of Geologic Structure On Radio Reception,"Radio fields at standard broadcast frequencies were examined over faults to determine how the geologic conditions affected the fields. The fields in rugged and densely inhabited areas were found to be too irregular to yield understandable patterns. Very small variations in the directions of the fields were suggested but not proven over the San Jacinto fault. No variations in intensity were found over the San Andreas fault, but variations were observed at some places over the Piedmont fault in New Jersey. Such variations might be due to higher conductivity of the fault zone, or to the addition of waves reflected and refracted at the fault surface. Weak areas near San Bernardino were noted, but could not be correlated with faults. It seems improbable that surveys using standard broadcast signals will be of much value in studying radio weak spots, although other approaches may be more revealing.",10.1190/1.1445039
Enhanced Subsurface Response For Marine Csem Surveying,"One of the main challenges of using marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) sounding for hydrocarbon detection has been a relatively low-resolution and restricted depth penetration. In addition, the use of CSEM in shallow waters has been perceived as particularly difficult. A new, robust method for enhancing marine CSEM subsurface response is particularly useful in shallow waters. The method is designed to reduce acquisition imprints and attenuate the dominant primary airwave contribution. Synthetic examples show that it is possible to detect thin, deeply buried 3D resistive bodies in a shallow-water environment with a complex resistivity structure. The results highlight the importance of a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.",10.1190/1.3377054
High-Order Finite-Difference Simulations Of Marine Csem Surveys Using A Correspondence Principle For Wave And Diffusion Fields,"The computer time required to solve a typical 3D marine controlled-source electromagnetic surveying (CSEM) simulation can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude by transforming low-frequency Maxwell equations in the quasi-static or diffusive limit to a hyperbolic set of partial differential equations that give a representation of electromagnetic fields in a fictitious wave domain. The dispersion and stability analysis can be made equivalent to that of other types of wave simulation problems such as seismic acoustic and elastic modeling. Second-order to eighth-order spatial derivative operators are implemented for flexibility. Fourth-order and sixth-order methods are the most numerically efficient implementations for this particular scheme. An implementation with high-order operators requires that both electric and magnetic fields are extrapolated simultaneously into the air layer. The stability condition given for high-order staggered-derivative operators here should be equally valid for seismic-wave simulation. The bandwidth of recovered fields in the diffusive domain is independent of the bandwidth of the fields in the fictitious wave domain. The fields in the fictitious wave domain do not represent observable fields. Propagation paths and interaction/reflection amplitudes are not altered by the transform from the fictitious wave domain to the diffusive frequency domain; however, the transform contains an exponential decay factor that damps down late arrivals in the fictitious wave domain. The propagation paths that contribute most to the diffusive domain fields are airwave (shallow water) plus typically postcritical events such as refracted and guided waves. The transform from the diffusive frequency domain to the fictitious wave domain is an ill-posed problem. The transform is nonunique. This gives a large degree of freedom in postulating temporal waveforms for boundary conditions in the fictitious wave domain that reproduce correct diffusive frequency-domain fields.",10.1190/1.3278525
Resistively Loaded Antennas For Ground-Penetrating Radar: A Modeling Approach,"The design of surface ground-penetrating radar (GPR) antennas is inherently difficult, primarily because the presence of the air-soil interface greatly complicates both analytic and laboratory-based approaches aimed at characterizing the antennas. Versatile numerical simulation techniques capable of describing the key physical principles governing GPR antenna radiation offer new solutions to this problem. We use a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations in three dimensions to explore the radiation characteristics of various bow-tie antennas (including quasi-linear antennas) operating in different environments. The antenna panels are either modeled as having an infinite conductivity [i.e., a perfect electrical conductor (PEC)], a constant finite conductivity, or a Wu-King finite-conductivity profile. Finite conductivities are accommodated through a subcell extension of the classical FDTD approach, with the model space surrounded by highly efficient generalized perfectly matched layer (GPML) absorbing boundary conditions. Our results show that input impedances, radiated waveforms, and radiation patterns of bow-tie antennas with Wu-King conductivity profiles are largely invariant when placed in free space or above diverse half-space earth models. By comparison, antennas with PEC or constant finite-conductivity panels have variable characteristics that depend somewhat on their operating environment. Quasi-linear antenna designs tend to be less sensitive in this respect, and hence may be suitable for a somewhat larger variety of soil conditions than planar bow-tie antennas characterized by large flare angles. Antennas with constant finite-conductivity panels are considerably more robust (i.e., less sensitive to their environment) than their PEC analogs because the loss resistance is increased, and the range over which a significant amount of current flow occurs is decreased when the antenna panels are resistively loaded. For the extreme case of Wu-King conductivity profiles, the current in the antenna panels approaches that of a quasi-infinitesimal electric dipole. This is shown by the surface-charge distributions on the various antennas and by the corresponding energy radiation patterns. Unfortunately, the favorable characteristics of the latter antennas are counterbalanced by markedly lower radiation efficiency. For the antenna designs considered in this study, we found that the peak energy radiated into earth models from bow-tie antennas with Wu-King conductivity profiles is about one order of magnitude lower than for antennas with PEC terminals.",10.1190/1.1926574
Gravitational Exploration And The Principle Of Equivalence,The equality of gravitational and inertial mass is mentioned by Einstein (1916) as an empirical principle constituting the basis of his Principle of Equivalence. The equivalence of gravitation and inertia implies that every phenomenon of gravitation can be explained as a phenomenon of inertia if observed inside an accelerated system.,10.1190/1.1439362
Magnetic Prospection On Prehistoric Sites In Western Canada,"Prehistoric sites in Western Canada present unusual conditions for magnetic prospection. Archaeological features are few and difficult to discern using standard prospection procedures. However, by addressing specific types of features, particularly fire hearths and fired rock and pottery, useful information about the cultural content of an archaeological site can be obtained. To secure comparative data, a number of replicative studies were conducted, with specific reference to determining a typical anomaly produced by the features. A small fire pit was kindled several times and repeatedly monitored with surveys using a single proton magnetometer. Fired rock received similar treatment. An in situ collection of local aboriginal pottery was also assayed. The experimental results indicated that fired rock will produce a detectable magnetic field after one firing, but a hearth must be rekindled at least three times to produce a significant anomaly. Pottery fragments also generate a small magnetic field which requires that the material be very close to the site surface to be discerned. The experiments also suggested that intepretation is enhanced by obtaining two magnetic readings per sensor station and using their difference to minimize ambient field fluctuations and natural magnetic variation caused by subsurface geology. The model data were used to interpret the results of a magnetic assessment of a large prehistoric campsite in Saskatchewan. Excavation results agreed well with the information provided by the predictive models. Two temporary dwelling remnants and two pottery vessels were exposed in areas determined to be magnetically significant. The magnetic assessment technique, when used to locate specific feature types, can be useful in prehistoric archaeological site assessment.",10.1190/1.1442109
Low-Frequency Fluid Waves In Fractures And Pipes,"Low-frequency analytical solutions have been obtained for phase velocities of symmetrical fluid waves within both an infinite fracture and a pipe filled with a viscous fluid. Three different fluid wave regimes can exist in such objects, depending on the various combinations of parameters, such as fluid density, fluid viscosity, walls shear modulus, channel thickness, and frequency. Equations for velocities of all these regimes have explicit forms and are verified by comparisons with the exact solutions. The dominant role of fractures in rock permeability at field scales and the strong amplitude and frequency effects of Stoneley guided waves suggest the importance of including these wave effects into poroelastic theories.",10.1190/1.3484155
Converted‐Wave Seismic Exploration: Methods,"Current P‐S sections are approaching (and in some cases exceeding) the quality of conventional P‐P seismic data. Interpretation of P‐S sections uses full elastic ray tracing, synthetic seismograms, correlation with P‐wave sections, and depth migration. Development of the P‐S method has taken about 20 years, but has now become commercially viable.",10.1190/1.1512781
Note On A Useful Approximation For Refraction Shooting,"The following paper represents a summary distilled from the paper written by the author in 1928 and retained in unpublished form to the present time. It is of some interest to note that the useful approximation derived forty years ago apparently has not been published elsewhere. In pre‐reflection days, forty years ago, the problem of subsurface profiling by refraction shooting in foreign wildcat areas was an interesting one. In such areas there might be, at best, a few rather questionable drillers' logs to give some advance idea of the formations to be encountered. There was no communication between the shot‐point and the recorder, frequently a mile or more distant, to give the instant of firing. Shots were fired and recorded with the aid of synchronized watches and had to be captured on a fifteen‐inch length of oscillograph film, for continuous rolls of paper were not yet available. On the phenomenal side, the prevalence of a velocity increase with depth, which caused a large deviation from elementary straight‐ray theory, was a factor just beginning to be recognized.",10.1190/1.1439978
3D Frequency-Domain Finite-Difference Viscoelastic-Wave Modeling Using Weighted Average 27-Point Operators With Optimal Coefficients,"Experimental data suggest that the viscoelastic behavior of rocks is more easily and accurately described in the frequency domain than in the time domain, supporting the idea of simulating seismic wave propagation in the frequency domain. We evaluated weighted-averaged 27-point finite-difference operators for 3D viscoelastic wave modeling in the frequency domain. Within the proposed framework, we developed general equations for normalized phase velocities that can be used with arbitrary finite-difference operators. Three sets of weighting coefficients for second-order central finite-difference operators that minimize the numerical dispersion for up to five grid points per wavelength were found using a damped least-squares (LS) criterion as well as a global optimization scheme based on l1- and l2-norm criteria. The three sets produced very similar dispersion curves, and improvement provided by global optimization appeared marginal in this respect. We also evaluated a discrete form for the heterogeneous formulation of the 3D viscoelastic equations with a perfectly match layer (PML). Heuristic performance assessment of frequency-dependent PML absorption coefficients provided a simple rule giving good results for eight PMLs at all frequencies. The proposed formalism was implemented with a massively parallel direct solver. Modeling results were compared with an analytic solution and a time-domain finite-difference code, and they gave good agreement when using LS and l2-norm optimal coefficients. On the other hand, l1-norm coefficients produced noisy results, indicating that minimizing the difference between analytic and numerical phase velocities, although necessary, is not a sufficient condition to guarantee low-numerical noise. Finally, analysis of the computational resources required to factorize the impedance matrix revealed that the memory complexity of the factorization is O(292N4) for an N3 grid, compared to O(30N4) for the viscoacoustic case.",10.1190/geo2013-0368.1
Removal Of Static Shift In Two Dimensions By Regularized Inversion,"A common problem in magnetotelluric (MT) sounding is the presence of static shifts in the data, i.e., a vertical shifting of the log‐apparent‐resistivity versus period curves relative to regional values (Jones, 1988; Jiracek, 1990; Berdichevsky et al., 1989). These static shifts are due to the presence of small‐scale, shallow conductivity anomalies near the measurement site. Electric charge builds up on near‐surface anomalies that are small in comparison to the skin depth of the electromagnetic (EM) fields. The charge buildup produces a perturbation of the measured electric fields from their regional values that persists to arbitrarily low frequencies. Incorrect removal of these local distortions leads to incorrect interpretation of the deeper targets of investigation.",10.1190/1.1443022
Theoretical Seismograms With Frequency And Depth Dependent Absorption,"In the computation of conventional theoretical (or ""synthetic"") seismograms, the effects of the variation of frequency‐dependent absorption with depth are presently ignored. Such absorption can produce significant differences in both the relative amplitudes and frequency spectra of primary and multiple reflections having the same arrival time. This paper describes a feasible way, using a digital computer of the IBM 7090 class, for computing theoretical seismograms which properly take into account the variation of absorption with both frequency and depth, it being assumed that the absorption coefficient varies linearly with frequency. It is pointed out that attempts to solve the problem using Fourier analysis in the frequency domain would lead to significant aliasing errors. Consequently a method borrowed from the field of network theory utilizing deconvolution is devised whereby solutions are obtained directly in the time domain. Both ""primary"" and ""primary‐plus‐all‐multiple"" traces are computed, the former including the ""peg‐leg"" multiples described by Anstey (1960) and Webster (1960). These calculations demonstrate that absorption can reduce the multiple content of theoretical seismograms.",10.1190/1.1439098
An Acoustic Wave Equation For Anisotropic Media,"A wave equation, derived using the acoustic medium assumption for P-waves in transversely isotropic (TI) media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI media), yields a good kinematic approximation to the familiar elastic wave equation for VTI media. The wavefield solutions obtained using this VTI acoustic wave equation are free of shear waves, which significantly reduces the computation time compared to the elastic wavefield solutions for exploding‐reflector type applications. From this VTI acoustic wave equation, the eikonal and transport equations that describe the ray theoretical aspects of wave propagation in a TI medium are derived. These equations, based on the acoustic assumption (shear wave velocity = 0), are much simpler than their elastic counterparts, yet they yield an accurate description of traveltimes and geometrical amplitudes. Numerical examples prove the usefulness of this acoustic equation in simulating the kinematic aspects of wave propagation in complex TI models.",10.1190/1.1444815
Estimating Source Location Using Normalized Magnetic Source Strength Calculated From Magnetic Gradient Tensor Data,"For a number of widely used models, normalized source strength (NSS) can be derived from eigenvalues of the magnetic gradient tensor. The NSS is proportional to a constant q normalized by the nth power of the distance between observation and integration points where q is a shape factor depending upon geometry of the model and n is the structural index. The NSS is independent of magnetization direction, and its amplitude is only affected by the magnitude of magnetization. The NSS is also a homogenous function and satisfies Euler's homogeneity equation. Therefore, Euler deconvolution of the NSS can be used to estimate source location. In our algorithm, we use data points enclosed by a square window centered at maxima of the NSS for simultaneously estimating the source location and structural index. The window size is increased until it exceeds a predefined limit. Then the most reliable solution is chosen based on some statistical analysis (minimum uncertainty). One of the advantages of the presented method is that it allows automatic identification of the structural index as the constant background field is eliminated. Another advantage is reduction of interference effects from neighboring sources by differentiation of the NSS. We have compared our method with the analytic signal amplitude and when the magnetic source contains remanent magnetization with a different direction to the inducing field, the NSS provides more reliable information about source geometry. Application of the method has been demonstrated on an aeromagnetic data set from the Tuckers Igneous Complex, Queensland, Australia. The NSS has improved interpretation of magnetic anomalies for this igneous complex, for which available geologic information shows relatively strong remanent magnetization.",10.1190/geo2011-0437.1
Multidimensional Signature Deconvolution And Free‐Surface Multiple Elimination Of Marine Multicomponent Ocean‐Bottom Seismic Data,"This paper presents a wave‐equation method for multidimensional signature deconvolution (designature) and elimination of free‐surface related multiples (demultiple) in four‐component (4C) ocean‐bottom seismic data. The designature/demultiple method has the following characteristics: it preserves primary amplitudes while attenuating free‐surface related multiples; it requires no knowledge of the sea floor‐parameters and the subsurface; it requires information only of the local density and acoustic wave propagation velocity just above the sea floor; it accommodates source arrays; and no information (except location) of the physical source array, its volume, and its radiation characteristics (wavelet) is required. Designature is an implicit part of the demultiple process; hence, the method is capable of transforming recorded reflection data excited by any source array below the sea surface into free‐surface demultipled data that would be recorded from a point source with any desired signature. In addition, the incident wavefield is not subtracted from the data prior to free‐surface demultiple; hence, separation of incident and scattered fields is not an issue as it is for most other free‐surface demultiple schemes. The designature/demultiple algorithm can be divided into two major computational steps. First, a multidimensional deconvolution operator, inversely proportional to the time derivative of the downgoing part of the normal component of the particle velocity just above the sea floor, is computed. Second, an integral equation is solved to find any component of the designatured, free‐surface demultipled multicomponent field. When the geology is horizontally layered, the designature and free‐surface demultiple scheme greatly simplifies and lends itself toward implementation in the τ‐p domain or frequency‐wavenumber domain as deterministic deconvolution of common shot gathers (or common receiver gathers when source array variations are negligible).",10.1190/1.1486770
Plane‐Layer Prestack Inversion In The Presence Of Surface Reverberation,"Experiments with synthetic data have indicated that generalized linear inversion may be used to estimate compressional velocities as a function of depth with high resolution directly from band‐limited, unstacked data. The ocean surface was not included in these experiments. In the presence of strong surface multiples, inversion is expected to take longer and be less accurate, because events from multiple surface reflections overlie primary events and normally have differing moveout. Existing velocity‐analysis techniques rely on the ability of an observer to make the difficult distinction between multiples and primaries. Equations are provided for adding the surface to the inversion procedure. This involves adding the surface effects to the Jacobian matrix as well as to the forward modeling procedure. To speed computation, the addition of the surface effects to the Jacobian matrix is delayed until after the matrix has been multiplied by a vector in the linear‐equation solution. Absorption is added to the inversion to represent the real world more closely and to improve computation speed by reducing sampling requirements. Realistic synthetic band‐limited data with high surface reverberation content were generated from a well‐log velocity profile. The inversion recovered the velocity profile to within 3 percent when a velocity increasing linearly with depth was used as a starting profile. The error in the model‐generated seismogram converges from 100 percent to within 2 percent of the reference data. The positions of interfaces are located more accurately at greater depths than at shallower depths because more sensors are observing deep strata than shallow strata. Convergence is to within 0.1 percent of that of the reference data at the maximum depth. The computation required 25 iterations and a total time of 66 hours on a DEC VAX 11/780. Reducing this time should be possible. In a preliminary study of the effects of noise, additive Gaussian noise was seen to limit the accuracy of the velocity estimate monotonically as the variance of the added noise was increased.",10.1190/1.1442225
Potential Field From A Dc Current Source Arbitrarily Located In A Nonuniform Layered Medium,"In this paper, I evaluate the potential field due to a dc current source located anywhere within a horizontally layered space, all layers possessing exponentially varying resistivities. The solution takes the form of Hankel transforms with their kernel expressions containing functions defined by recursion formulas. The resulting expressions can be used to model any kind of resistivity array. Specializing the general solution to full‐ or half‐space models possessing exponential dependence, I find terms I interpret as primary and secondary contributions. Analytic expressions for the secondary electrical field revealed an error in the Stoyer and Wait solution for a half‐space. To test the derived n-layer solution based on recursion formulas, I modeled resistivity logs for both homogeneous layers and intercalated homogeneous and heterogeneous layers. Curves from the theory reproduced asymmetries and ripples observed in real resistivity logs.",10.1190/1.1444857
Implications Of The Born Approximation For The Magnetotelluric Problem In Three‐Dimensional Environments,"A first‐order Born approximation is obtained for the integral equations governing the surface magnetotelluric response over a three‐dimensional earth. Although accurate only in cases of low resistivity contrasts, the resulting expressions: (1) exhibit a linear relationship between a spatial perturbation in subsurface resistivity and the ensuing perturbation on the surface field response, and, more importantly, (2) allow arbitrary degrees of complexity in the geometrical characteristics of the subsurface. The linear system solutions derived from the Born approximation are studied by examining the properties of their associated kernels. These kernels may be thought of as a suite of horizontal magnetotelluric ""wavelets"" weighting the subsurface resistivity distribution at different depth levels. Analytical expressions for the wavelets are obtained in the wavenumber domain, thus generating a suite of magnetotelluric ""transfer functions."" Expressions for the latter are particularized to the cases of one‐ and two‐dimensional geolectric media yielding results consistent with the characteristics of the magnetotelluric fields known to hold in these low‐order environments. Inspection of the electric transfer functions reveals severe sensitivity to near‐surface lateral variations of resistivity, which persists even at deep sensing frequencies. This near‐surface sensitivity is the result of an additive term in the electric field transfer functions, the static component, acting as a spatial highpass filter of the lateral variations of surface resistivity. A second additive component in the electric transfer functions, the induction component, functions as a spatial lowpass filter of the lateral variations in subsurface resistivity, and is primarily responsible for the inductive part of the surface electric field response. A common problem in magnetotelluric interpretation, the electric static effect can be reduced by inverting the role of the static component, i.e., by spatially low‐pass filtering the surface electric field. The suggested low‐pass filter for such an operation is one for which the cutoff wavenumber increases with frequency and is therefore insensitive to the response from the induction component. Low‐pass filtering of the surface electric field is best implemented in the field if the electric dipoles are deployed end‐to‐end continuously along a survey path. The magnetic field transfer functions, on the other hand, exhibit a single induction term with band‐pass filter properties which may actually lead to some amount of local distortion on the measured surface magnetic field. We propose to reduce this distortion by referring all electric field measurements to the primary magnetic field within the survey area. The primary magnetic field components, in turn, can be estimated by the spatial average of the magnetic measurements acquired at an array of magnetic stations. The suggested procedures for both the acquisition and processing of natural electric and magnetic field data encompass altogether a novel adaptation of the magnetotelluric method.",10.1190/1.1443272
Static Corrections From Shallow‐Reflection Surveys,"Shallow seismic reflection surveys can assist in determination of velocity and/or thickness variations in near‐surface layers. Static corrections to seismic reflection data compensate for velocity and thickness variations within the ""weathered zone."" An uncompensated weathered‐layer thickness variation on the order of 1 m across the length of a geophone array can distort the spectrum of the signal and result in aberrations on final stacked data. P-wave velocities in areas where the weathered zone is composed of unconsolidated materials can be substantially less than the velocity of sound in air. Weathered‐layer thickness variation of 1 m in these low‐velocity materials could result in a static anomaly in excess of 3 ms. Shallow‐reflection data from the Texas panhandle illustrate a real geologic situation with sufficient variability in the near surface to significantly affect seismic signal reflected from depths commonly targeted by conventional reflection surveys. Synthetic data approximating a conventional reflection survey combined with a weathered‐layer model generated from shallow‐reflection data show the possible dramatic static effects of alluvium. Shallow high‐resolution reflection surveys can be used both to determine the severity of intra‐array statics and to assist in the design of a filter to remove much of the distortion such statics cause on deeper reflection data. The static effects of unconsolidated materials can be even more dramatic on S-wave reflection surveys than on comparable P-wave surveys.",10.1190/1.1442889
Joint Inversion Of Gravity And Magnetic Data For Two-Layer Models,"Gravity and magnetic data are inverted jointly in terms of a model consisting of an interface separating two layers having a constant density and magnetization contrast. A damped least-squares inversion is used to determine the topography of the interface. The inversion requires knowledge of the physical property contrasts across the interface and its average depth. Since the relationship between model parameters and data is weakly nonlinear, a constant damped least-squares inverse is used during the iterative solution search. The effect of this inverse is closely related to a downward continuation of the field to the average interface depth. The method is used to map the base of the Sept-Iles mafic intrusion, Quebec, Canada, and the shape of the central uplift at the Chicxulub impact crater, Yucatan, Mexico. At Sept-Iles, the intrusion reaches a thickness of   7 km  , coincident with the maximum gravity anomaly, south of the intrusion center. At Chicxulub, the top of the central uplift is modeled to be   3.5 km   deep and has a single peak form.",10.1190/1.2194514
Extended Local Rytov Fourier Migration Method,"We develop a novel depth‐migration method termed the extended local Rytov Fourier (ELRF) migration method. It is based on the scalar wave equation and a local application of the Rytov approximation within each extrapolation interval. Wavefields are Fourier transformed back and forth between the frequency‐space and frequency‐wavenumber domains during wavefield extrapolation. The lateral slowness variations are taken into account in the frequency‐space domain. The method is efficient due to the use of a fast Fourier transform algorithm. Under the small angle approximation, the ELRF method leads to the split‐step Fourier (SSF) method that is unconditionally stable. The ELRF method and the extended local Born Fourier (ELBF) method that we previously developed can handle wider propagation angles than the SSF method and account for the phase and amplitude changes due to the lateral variations of slowness, whereas the SSF method only accounts for the phase changes. The stability of the ELRF method is controlled more easily than that of the ELBF method.",10.1190/1.1444657
Difficulties In Scanning Current Geophysical Literature,"We have read with great interest Mr. Hutchison's paper entitled ""Magnetic Analysis by Logarithmic Curves"" (GEOPHYSICS, v. 23, p. 749-769) concerning a problem treated by ourselves at the 12th Congress of the European Association of Exploration Geophysicists at Brussels in June, 1957.",10.1190/1.24030001.1
Quantitative Lithostratigraphic Interpretation Of Seismic Data For Characterization Of The Unayzah Formation In Central Saudi Arabia,"Last, seismic facies analysis with pattern recognition applied to 2‐D exploratory lines, partly intersecting the 3‐D data set, led to the identification of potential prospects (Unayzah interval with a high sand–shale ratio).",10.1190/1.1512742
Microseismic Reflection Imaging And Its Application To The Basel Geothermal Reservoir,"We have developed a new approach for reflection seismic imaging using microseismic waveform data. We took the specific character of microseismic downhole data into account and were able to image regions in the direct vicinity or inside of a seismically active zone. We used a directional migration method that reduced imaging artifacts caused by the low aperture of the data, but required estimation of the wavefield polarization. We also used hodogram analysis to identify parts of data that provided reliable polarization estimates. Only these parts were then used for imaging, whereas the rest of the data are excluded. The approach was successfully applied to microseismic waveforms recorded during and after the stimulation of the enhanced geothermal system in Basel, Switzerland. This data set included more than 2000 events recorded at five sparsely distributed borehole sensors. The reflection images revealed a distinct network of reflectors in the vicinity of the open hole section within the injection well. The results were compared with the injection borehole ultrasonic image revealing a quite good agreement. Combined analysis of imaged reflectors, event locations, and event focal mechanisms indicated that the approach resolved mostly aseismic highly permeable fluid pathways, whereas most of the seismicity occurred in the second-order fractures.",10.1190/geo2014-0593.1
Differential Form And Numerical Implementation Of Biot'S Poroelasticity Equations With Squirt Dissipation,"The squirt-flow wave attenuation mechanism is implemented in Biot's theory of poroelasticity in the form of differential equations. All the stiffnesses involved in the stress-strain relation become complex and frequency dependent, which can exactly be expressed in terms of kernels based on the Zener mechanical model. In the time domain, this approach implies time convolutions, which are circumvented by introducing memory variables. The differential equations are consistent with Gassmann's and Mavko-Jizba equations at low and high frequencies, respectively. All the coefficients in the poro-viscoelastic differential equations have a clear physical meaning and can be obtained or estimated from independent measurements. The key additional parameters are the dry-rock bulk modulus at a confining pressure where all the compliant pores are closed, i.e., a hypothetical rock without the soft porosity, the grain-contact aspect ratio and the compliant porosity. We recasted the wave equation in the particle-velocity/stress formulation and solved it by using a time-splitting technique and the Fourier pseudospectral method to compute the spatial derivatives. The algorithm can be used to obtain synthetic wave fields in inhomogeneous media.",10.1190/geo2010-0169.1
Why Do Laplace-Domain Waveform Inversions Yield Long-Wavelength Results?,"Laplace-domain inversions generate long-wavelength velocity models from synthetic and field data sets, unlike full-waveform inversions in the time or frequency domain. By examining the gradient directions of Laplace-domain inversions, we explain why they result in long-wavelength velocity models. The gradient direction of the inversion is calculated by multiplying the virtual source and the back-propagated wavefield. The virtual source has long-wavelength features because it is the product of the smooth forward-modeled wavefield and the partial derivative of the impedance matrix, which depends on the long-wavelength initial velocity used in the inversion. The back-propagated wavefield exhibits mild variations, except for near the receiver, in spite of the short-wavelength components in the residual. The smooth back-propagated wavefield results from the low-wavenumber pass-filtering effects of Laplace-domain Green's function, which attenuates the high-wavenumber components of the residuals more rapidly than the low-wavenumber components. Accordingly, the gradient direction and the inversion results are smooth. Examples of inverting field data acquired in the Gulf of Mexico exhibit long-wavelength gradients and confirm the generation of long-wavelength velocity models by Laplace-domain inversion. The inversion of moving-average filtered data without short-wavelength features shows that the Laplace-domain inversion is not greatly affected by the high-wavenumber components in the field data.",10.1190/geo2012-0365.1
On Techniques With Seismic Interval Timers,"In the paper by J. C. Stam (Geophysics, April, 1962, pp. 198–212) reviewing developments in shallow seismic refraction techniques, the single‐channel seismographs using a time counting circuit are discussed. I would like to take the opportunity of commenting on techniques in use with this type of instrument.",10.1190/1.1439112
Evaluation Of Anisotropy By Shear‐Wave Splitting,"The polarizations of three‐component shear wavetrains carry unique information about the internal structure of the rock through which they pass: specifically, commonly observed shear‐wave splitting may contain information about the orientation of crack distributions. This information cannot usually be recovered from shear waves recorded at the free surface because of interference with the interaction of the shear wave with the surface, even for nearly vertical incidence. However, shear‐wave splitting in synthetic three‐component vertical seismic profiles, in some cases, may be interpreted directly in terms of the direction of strike of vertical cracks. Because the human eye is not skilled at identifying the phase relationships between three‐component seismograms played out conventionally as parallel time‐series, the polarizations are displayed in orthogonal sections of the particle displacements to facilitate recognition and evaluation of the shear‐wave splitting. Estimating the orientations of cracks, and hence of preferred directions of flow, by seismic investigations could be of crucial importance to production and reservoir engineering.",10.1190/1.1441824
Optimized 3D Synthetic Aperture For Controlled-Source Electromagnetics,"Locating offshore hydrocarbon reservoirs has become more challenging with smaller, deeper, or shallow-water targets in complicated environments. Controlled-source electromagnetics (CSEM) is a geophysical method used to find reservoirs in marine settings. The diffusive nature of CSEM fields means that the signal from the target is only a small part of the total field. To reduce the impact of the complicated settings and to improve the detecting capabilities of CSEM, we have applied a synthetic aperture to CSEM data. The synthetic aperture virtually increased the length and width of the CSEM source by combining the responses from multiple individual sources. Applying a weight to each source steered or focused the synthetic aperture source array in the inline and crossline directions. We have developed an optimization method to find the optimal weights for synthetic aperture arrays that adapted to the information about the reservoirs in the CSEM data. To demonstrate the benefits of a weighted synthetic aperture, we have applied a 2D synthetic aperture array and a crossline-only synthetic aperture array to noisy, simulated electromagnetic fields. Both synthetic aperture arrays reduced the noise and increased the detectability of the modeled reservoirs when compared with the original CSEM response. The crossline-only synthetic aperture array also preserved the structural information within the measurements.",10.1190/geo2014-0348.1
Full‐Wave Acoustic Logging: Synthetic Microseismograms And Frequency‐Wavenumber Analysis,"The discrete wavenumber method is used to compute synthetic full‐waveform acoustic logs in axisymmetric multilayered boreholes and to perform the frequency‐wavenumber analysis of the radiated wave field. The stress‐displacement vector is propagated through the layers using a numerically improved formulation of the Thomson‐Haskell method. In the time domain, all the trapped and interface modes overlap. On the contrary, the representations of the spectral energy density of the scattered wave field in the frequency axial‐wavenumber domain, for various radial positions of observation, allow the recognition and identification of the different wave types as well as their repartition of energy. In particular, these diagrams show the close relation between the resonance frequencies of the borehole and the significant low‐frequency energy of the pseudo‐Rayleigh modes. They also facilitate the interpretation of some of the physical phenomena which occur during the propagation in a complex borehole environment. We present the configurations of a well‐bonded and unbonded cased hole, an invaded zone, and a mudcake. For all of these models, we consider a ""fast"" formation in which the S-wave velocity is higher than the bore fluid velocity and a ""slow"" formation. The presence of an elastic tool at the center of the borehole is also investigated.  The associated microseismograms, computed for a series of source‐receiver spacings, characterize in the time domain the observations previously made.",10.1190/1.1441865
Curvature Of A Geometric Surface And Curvature Of Gravity And Magnetic Anomalies,"Curvature describes how much a line deviates from being straight or a surface from being flat. When curvature is used to interpret gravity and magnetic anomalies, we try to delineate geometric information of subsurface structures from an observed nongeometric quantity. In this work, I evaluated curvature attributes of the equipotential surface as functions of gravity gradients and analyzed the differences between the theoretical derivation and a practical application. I computed curvature of a synthetic model that consisted of representative structures (ridge, valley, basin, dome, and vertical cylinder) and curvature of the equipotential surface, gravity, and vertical gravity gradient (which is equivalent to the magnetic reduction-to-the-pole result) due to the same model. A comparison of curvature of such a geometric surface and curvature of different gravity quantities was then made to help understand these curvature differences and an indirect link between curvature of gravity data and actual structures. Finally, I applied curvature analysis to a magnetic anomaly grid in the Gaspé belt of Quebec, Canada, to illustrate its useful property of enhancing subtle features.",10.1190/geo2014-0108.1
Ammonium Nitrate Blasting Agents,"I have read with interest the article by Jack Martin and Thomas O. Hall on ammonium nitrate blasting agents in seismic work (GEOPHYSICS, v. 24, p. 155–163).",10.1190/1.24030002.1
Bayesian Inversion Of Csem And Magnetotelluric Data,"We have developed a Bayesian methodology for inversion of controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) data and magnetotelluric (MT) data. The inversion method provided optimal solutions and also the associated uncertainty for any sets of electric and magnetic components and frequencies from CSEM and MT data. The method is based on a 1D forward modeling method for the electromagnetic (EM) response for a plane-layered anisotropic earth model. The inversion method was also designed to invert common midpoint (CMP)-sorted data along a 2D earth profile assuming locally horizontal models in each CMP position. The inversion procedure simulates from the posterior distribution using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) approach based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The method that we use integrates available geologic prior knowledge with the information in the electromagnetic data such that the prior model stabilizes and constrains the inversion according to the described knowledge. The synthetic examples demonstrated that inclusion of more data generally improves the inversion results. Compared to inversion of the inline electric component only, inclusion of broadside and magnetic components and an extended set of frequency components moderately decreased the uncertainty of the inversion. The results were strongly dependent on the prior knowledge imposed by the prior distribution. The prior knowledge about the background resistivity model surrounding the target was highly important for a successful and reliable inversion result.",10.1190/geo2010-0298.1
Kirchhoff Integral Extrapolation And Migration Of Nonplanar Data,"The form of the Kirchhoff integral commonly used for migration of seismic data assumes that the observation surface is a flat, horizontal plane. This restriction is not necessary in theory or practice. A useful integral expression can be obtained for an arbitrary observation surface by use of the Kirchhoff approximation for relating the field on the observation surface to its normal derivative. Kirchhoff migration is usually carried out by an integral that represents summation over receivers for a given shot. Summation over shots is not explicitly handled. By invoking the principle of reciprocity and applying the Kirchhoff integral twice, one arrives at an integral expression that explicitly represents shot and receiver summation, contains the factors needed to compensate for nonplanar survey geometry, and can be used for wave extrapolation as well as migration. Adaptation of this integral to handling 2-D or line survey data is straightforward and, with the usual approximations concerning spherical wave spreading, it accomplishes 2-D wave extrapolation and migration. By tabulating both average and rms velocity functions, the Kirchhoff integral can be used to handle cases where the velocity changes vertically and the survey surface has vertical relief. The approximations involved are only those usually required in calculations of rms velocity traveltime. Migration is illustrated by treatment of two model data sets. One data set has shots and receivers extended horizontally with the receiver path undergoing strong elevation changes and the shot path flat. Migration of this data set illustrates the effect of the geometrical weighting factors and the effectiveness of the rms velocity approximation. The second data set is a vertical seismic profile (VSP) with shots extended horizontally and receivers extended vertically down a single well. Migration of this VSP data yields a useful image for a reasonable distance away from the well. Migration of nonplanar survey data is quite practical with geometrical artifacts that are manageable. The technique has use for surveys taken over nonplanar topography, for imaging from VSP data, and in a dual role for treatment of velocity anomalies, i.e., first as a wave extrapolation procedure to move below the anomaly and then as a migration procedure applied to the nonplanar extrapolated data.",10.1190/1.1441752
Discrete Time Solution Of Plane P‐Sv Waves In A Plane Layered Medium,"For plane waves at normal incidence to a layered elastic medium, both the forward and inverse discrete time problems have been previously solved. In this paper the forward problem of calculating the waves in a medium of plane, homogeneous, isotropic layers is extended to P and SV body waves at nonnormal incidence, where the horizontal phase velocity of each wave is greater than the shear and compressional velocities of each layer. Vertical traveltimes for P and SV waves through each layer are rounded off to unequal integer multiples of a small time increment Δτ. This gives a 4×4 layer matrix analogous to the 2×2 layer matrix for normal incidence obtained by previous authors. Reflection and transmission responses recorded at the free surface of a layered half space are derived as matrix series in integer powers of the Fourier transform variable z=e-iωΔτ. These responses are generated recursively by polynomial division and include all multiply reflected P and SV waves with mode conversions. It is shown that the reflection response matrix generated by a source at the free surface equals the product of a constant matrix and the positive time part of the autocorrelation matrix of the transmission response matrix due to a deep source. This is an extension to nonnormal incidence of a theorem proved by Claerbout for acoustic waves at normal incidence.",10.1190/1.1440085
Electrical And Seismic Properties Of The Earth'S Crust In The Southwestern Great Plains Of The U.S.A.,"Data from 20 magnetotelluric stations were used to determine a resistivity‐depth distribution for the crust in western Texas. We computed one‐dimensional models, which adequately explained the apparent resistivities obtained from the elements of a rotated impedance tensor. Descriptions of the method of data processing and model computation are given. The derived model includes an anisotropic, low resistivity layer at depths slightly greater than 20 km. The resistivity model is compared with a seismic velocity interpretation for eastern New Mexico, and the low resistivity layer is inferred to coincide with a zone of low seismic velocity. The base of the low velocity‐low resistivity region occurs at the transition from intermediate to more basic rocks in the crust. The low resistivity values are interpreted as resulting from interstitial fluid. This fluid may cause low seismic velocities and may form a weak region in which continental earthquakes occur. Interstitial water at depth in the crust may be produced by the intersection of the crustal temperature‐depth curve and equilibrium boundaries of hydrothermal reactions.",10.1190/1.1440176
Improved 1D Inversions For Sea Ice Thickness And Conductivity From Electromagnetic Induction Data: Inclusion Of Nonlinearities Caused By Passive Bucking,"The porosity of sea ice is a fundamental physical parameter that governs the mechanical strength of sea ice and the mobility of gases and nutrients for biological processes and biogeochemical cycles in the sea ice layer. However, little is known about the spatial distribution of the sea ice porosity and its variability between different sea ice types; an efficient and nondestructive method to measure this property is currently missing. Sea ice porosity is linked to the bulk electrical conductivity of sea ice, a parameter routinely used to discriminate between sea ice and seawater by electromagnetic (EM) induction sensors. Here, we have evaluated the prospect of porosity retrieval of sea ice by means of bulk conductivity estimates using 1D multifrequency EM inversion schemes. We have focused on two inversion algorithms, a smoothness-constrained inversion and a Marquardt-Levenberg inversion, which we modified for the nonlinear signal bias caused by a passive bucking coil operated in such a highly conductive environment. Using synthetic modeling studies, 1D inversion algorithms and multiple frequencies, we found that we can resolve the sea ice conductivity within ±0.01  S/m. Using standard assumptions for the conductivity-porosity relation of sea ice, we were able to estimate porosity with an uncertainty of ±1.2%, which enables efficient and nondestructive surveys of the internal state of the sea ice cover.",10.1190/geo2015-0130.1
"Joining Up Land And Marine Seismic Data: Case Study From Procida And Ventotene Islands (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy)","The seismic refraction survey, routinely used to obtain information on subsurface geology, has a limited use in the foreshore zone. We have evaluated a nonstandard approach to acquire seismic data in the backshore-foreshore area, joining up land and marine seismic data. The innovative part was the acquisition of a continuous seismic profile that allowed the recording of high-resolution data in a transition zone (TZ) to establish an integrated approach for improving the land-marine seismic model in areas characterized by a complex near surface geology. To achieve this objective, two seismic tests were carried out along the beaches of the Tyrrhenian islands of Procida and Ventotene. We defined the P-wave VP and S-wave velocities VS with depth by integrating the tomography of the refracted first arrivals (VP velocities versus depth) with the inversion of the phase velocities dispersion curves extracted from the surface waves (1D VS velocities models). Working with both seismic methods allowed us to overcame the limitations of each approach and to compare and check the obtained results. The velocity models enabled resolution of the near-surface velocity variations and definition of refractors down to a maximum depth of 40 m below ground level. This has provided useful insights to map the 2D bedrock surface and to evaluate ground stiffness and dynamic behavior of soil. Our study, aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution seismic surveys in the land-sea TZ, proved that the use of a marine streamer connected to land cable, was a powerful tool to define different subsoil structures to assist with future planning (coastal management) of these areas.",10.1190/geo2014-0392.1
A Homotopy Method For Well-Log Constraint Waveform Inversion,"The primary difficulty posed by the method of waveform inversion for the acoustic-wave equation is the presence of local minima of the objective function. Waveform inversion fails to converge to the global minimum unless the wavefield contains very low frequencies, or the starting model is very close to the true model. Constraints can improve the convergence of the method; however, if the starting model is far from the correct model, normal iterative methods will still get trapped in local minima. We designed a homotopy method to improve the robustness of waveform inversion; it makes natural use of constraints, such as well logs. In addition, to further condition the inverse problem, we incorporate standard Tikhonov regularization. We demonstrate through a synthetic example that our method is more likely to find a global minimum than normal iterative methods.",10.1190/1.2387117
Analysis Of Errors In Barometric Elevations In Northern Nigeria,"We present an analysis of errors contributing to the inaccuracy of aneroid altimeter observations under tropical conditions. Instrumental errors were investigated experimentally, while errors due to meterological factors were analyzed using an autocorrelation analysis of actual pressure observations. For an estimated accuracy of ±1.2 to ±2.5 m, it is recommended that a diurnal pressure variation be eliminated from the altimeter field readings and that measurements be restricted to 0500 to 1400 hours LST in the wet season and from 0500 to 1100 hours LST or 1500 to 1830 hours LST in the dry season.",10.1190/1.1441113
Using The Analytic Signal Amplitude To Determine The Location And Depth Of Thin Dikes From Magnetic Data,"A semiautomatic method to determine the location and depth of thin dykes is introduced. The ratio of analytic signal amplitudes of orders 0 and 1 of the magnetic anomaly from a thin dike was used to give the distance r to the dike. Local minima of r gave the depth to the dike, and the position of these minima gave its horizontal location. Because in the method we used just the magnetic field and its first-order derivatives, it was less sensitive to noise than were higher order derivative-based methods. Once the position of the dike has been determined, then its dip and susceptibility-thickness product can be calculated from the analytic signal amplitude, providing that the magnetization vector is known.",10.1190/geo2014-0061.1
Adaptive Finite-Element Modeling Using Unstructured Grids: The 2D Magnetotelluric Example,"Existing numerical modeling techniques commonly used for electromagnetic (EM) exploration are bound by the limitations of approximating complex structures using a rectangular grid. A more flexible tool is the adaptive finite-element (FE) method using unstructured grids. Composed of irregular triangles, an unstructured grid can readily conform to complicated structural boundaries. To ensure numerical accuracy, adaptive refinement using an a posteriori error estimator is performed iteratively to refine the grid where solution accuracy is insufficient. Two recently developed asymptotically exact a posteriori error estimators are based on a superconvergent gradient recovery operator. The first relies solely on the normed difference between the recovered gradients and the piecewise constant FE gradients and is effective for lowering the global error in the FE solution. For many problems, an accurate solution is required only in a few discreteregions and a more efficient error estimator is possible by considering the local influence of errors from coarse elements elsewhere in the grid. The second error estimator accomplishes this by using weights determined from the solution to an appropriate dual problem to modify the first error estimator. Application of these methods for 2D magnetotelluric (MT) modeling reveals, as expected, that the dual weighted error estimator is far more efficient in achieving accurate MT responses. Refining about 15% of elements per iteration gives the fastest convergence rate. For a given refined grid, the solution error at higher frequencies varies in proportion to the skin depth, requiring refinement about every two decades of frequency. The transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes exhibit different field behavior, and refinement should consider the effects of both. An example resistivity model of seafloor bathymetry underlain by complex salt intrusions and dipping and faulted sedimentary layers illustrates the benefits of this new technique.",10.1190/1.2348091
Application Of Mud Analysis Logging,"The mud analysis logging system, now widely used for exploratory and routine drilling, continuously analyzes and records the oil and gas content of mud returns from wells being drilled by the rotary method. Oil or gas detected in the returning drilling fluid indicates oil or gas in the formation penetrated by the bit. Results of the continuous analyses are instrumentally correlated to the depths and formations from which the showings originated. A second useful phase of the system plots accurately and in detail rate of penetration or drilling speed on the log as a function of depth. Trucks and trailers provide a mobile housing for all of the mud analysis equipment so that it may be moved rapidly from well to well. Applications of the method may be divided into two classes: 1. Routine drilling in proved areas where it eliminates unnecessary coring, and locates gas caps and completion zones. 2. Exploratory drilling in which it minimizes coring by indicating for testing purposes porous zones containing oil and/or gas. Mud analysis logging can be practiced in areas where the electrical log cannot be used due to high salt content or other local conditions, where dangerous hole conditions make interruption of drilling operations for coring inadvisable, and for evaluating gas zones where cores are difficult to interpret. In addition, each mud analysis logging unit contains equipment to obtain information useful in eliminating washouts, in predicting and preventing blowouts, and in controlling drilling mud characteristics.",10.1190/1.1437151
"Vp/Vs Ratio And Shear-Wave Splitting In The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone: Insights Into Effective Stress, Pore Pressure, And Sediment Consolidation","To estimate variation of stress state and sediment consolidation in the Nankai plate subduction zone off southwest Japan, we measured the P-wave to S-wave velocity ratio (VP/VS) and S-wave splitting along the seismic line extending from the trench to the seismogenic zone. For this purpose, we used active-source seismic data recorded by multicomponent ocean bottom seismometers (OBS). Because it is difficult to identify the PS-converted reflection waveforms for each of the geological boundaries in this deep offshore region, we focused on the more easily identified PPS-refracted waveforms that register the conversion of the up-going P-waves to S-waves at the igneous crust surface. We estimated the average VP/VS ratio within the sedimentary section by using the time lag between the P-refracted waves and PPS-converted waves. This VP/VS ratio changes abruptly at the trough axis (i.e., the deformation front of the accretionary prism) arguably because of compaction associated with the accretion process. We observed relatively high VP/VS around the seismogenic megasplay fault, which may partially indicate the abnormal pore pressure and intensive fractures associated with the fault. To estimate the stress-induced fracture orientation and stress magnitude, we computed the fast S-wave polarization direction and estimated S-wave velocity anisotropy by applying the crosscorrelation method to the PPS-converted waves. To improve signal-to-noise ratio of the waveform for S-wave splitting analysis, we stacked PPS-converted waveforms on receiver gather. These anisotropic characteristics change at the seismogenic megasplay fault: the fast polarization direction is nearly parallel to the subduction direction seaward of the megasplay fault and is perpendicular to the subduction direction landward of the megasplay fault. This velocity anisotropy is especially strong around the megasplay fault. These results imply that the preferred fracture orientation, as well as the principal stress orientation, is oblique to the direction of plate subduction near the megasplay fault.",10.1190/1.3560018
The Field Of A Magnetic Dipole In The Presence Of A Conducting Sphere,"Formulas are derived for the components of the distorted field of a magnetic dipole in the presence of a conducting sphere in a homogeneous medium. In the method employed the field is resolved into two partial fields for the first of which the radial component of the magnetic vector vanishes and for the second of which the radial component of the electric vector vanishes. From the general formulas approximate formulas are derived for the field components in the special case in which the conductivity of the medium is low, the radius of the sphere is not too large and both the dipole and the observer are in the vicinity of the sphere. These approximate formulas are within limits applicable to the problem of locating a spherical body of ore buried in a mass of rock.",10.1190/1.1437921
"Geophysical Characterization Of The Menengai Volcano, Central Kenya Rift From The Analysis Of Magnetotelluric And Gravity Data","In this study, we qualitatively analyze detailed gravity and broadband magnetotelluric data in and surrounding the Menengai volcano of the East African rift in Kenya to assess geothermal potential of the region. Three-dimensional gravity models obtained by inverting residual gravity anomalies and 2D resistivity models obtained by inverting the transverse electric and transverse magnetic magnetotelluric modes show several common features. Our models show that a low-resistivity zone above a higher resistivity zone correlates with a low-density region located 1–4 km beneath the volcano. These zones may be related to a high temperature gradient or hydrothermally altered, fractured rocks. Additionally, a low-resistivity (20  ohm-m) and a low-density region located approximately 4–6 km below the volcano may be related to molten material that is the source of heat for the geothermal system. The low-resistivity (20  ohm-m) regions that correlated with a denser (2.8–2.9  g/cc) region within the caldera are bounded by high-resistivity (250  ohm-m), high-density (2.9) volcanic units implying that the dense and electrically resistive volcanic material is relatively cool and lacks significant fluid content that can lower resistivity. At shallow depths, 0.5–1.5 km below the caldera, a low-resistivity and low-to-moderate density region is interpreted as a zone with high fracture density that consists of clay minerals resulting from hydrothermal alteration. These results agree well with the results from previous seismic studies on the depth of the suggested molten rocks.",10.1190/geo2011-0419.1
Multiwavelet Prestack Kirchhoff Migration,"The problems of stretching and aliasing usually occur in prestack Kirchhoff migration. A multiwavelet-based approach is proposed to provide an alternative approach to resolve these problems. Two steps are involved in the multiwavelet-based algorithm: The first step is the decomposition of the seismic traces with a series of wavelets of different dominant frequencies. This step is based on the principle of basis pursuit and is enhanced for more accurate and sparse decomposition by adding an adaptive subdictionary that is associated with the minima and maxima of a seismic trace. The second step is wavelet migration based on the Kirchhoff formulation using a novel approach. The outer iteration is the wavelets of the input seismic traces, which ensures that an input wavelet is only used once in the entire migration process. This enables output of multiple migrated images of different wavelets of dominant frequency ranges, elimination of noisy images, and composition of images for specific interpretation and reservoir characterization purposes with very little extra computational cost. The stretching and aliasing problems are naturally resolved because interpolation on the seismic trace is not required in the migration. We tested the algorithm using a synthetic model with a dipping layer and a 2D real seismic section. We compared our results with results obtained by conventional Kirchhoff migration.",10.1190/geo2015-0140.1
A Least‐Squares Minimization Approach To Invert Gravity Data,"The interpretation of gravity data often involves initial steps to eliminate or attenuate unwanted field components in order to isolate the desired anomaly (e.g., residual‐regional separations). These initial filtering operations include, for example, the radial weights methods (Griffin, 1949; Elkins, 1951; Abdelrahman et al., 1990), the fast Fourier transform methods (Bhattacharyya, 1965; Clarke, 1969; Meskó, 1969, 1984, Botezatu, 1970), the rational approximation techniques (Agarwal and Lal, 1971) and recursion filters (Bhattacharyya, 1976), and the bicubic spline approximation techniques (Bhattacharyya, 1969; Inoue, 1986). The derived local gravity anomalies are then geologically interpreted to derive depth estimates, often without properly accounting for the uncertainties introduced by the filtering process. When filters are applied to observed data, the filters often cause serious distortions in the shape of the gravity anomalies (Hammer, 1977). Thus the filtered gravity anomalies generally yield unreliable geologic interpretations (Rao and Radhakrishnamurthy, 1965; Hammer, 1977; Abdelrahman et al., 1985, 1989.",10.1190/1.1442946
Krauklis Wave Initiation In Fluid-Filled Fractures By Seismic Body Waves,"Krauklis waves are a special wave mode that is bound to and propagates along fluid-filled fractures. They can repeatedly propagate back and forth along a fracture and eventually fall into resonance emitting a seismic signal with a dominant characteristic frequency. They are of great interest because this resonant behavior can lead to strongly frequency-dependent propagation effects for seismic body waves and may explain seismic tremor generation in volcanic areas or affect microseismic signals in fractured fluid reservoirs. It has been demonstrated that Krauklis waves can be initiated by a seismic source inside the fracture, for example by hydrofracturing. Here, the aim is to study Krauklis wave initiation by an incident plane P- or S-wave in numerical simulations. Both seismic body waves are reflected and scattered at the fracture, but also, two Krauklis waves are initiated with significant amplitude, one at each fracture tip (i.e., at the diffraction-points of the fracture). Generally, the incident S-wave initiates larger-amplitude Krauklis waves compared to the incident P-wave case. For both incident wave modes, the initiation of Krauklis waves strongly depends on the fracture orientation. In the case of an incident P-wave, large-amplitude Krauklis waves are initiated at moderate (12°–40°) and high (65°) inclination angles of the fracture with a distinct gap at approximately 50°. The dependency of Krauklis wave initiation on fracture orientation is almost inversed in the case of an incident S-wave and the largest-amplitude Krauklis waves are initiated at an S-wave incidence angle of approximately 50°. The initiation of large-amplitude Krauklis waves by both P- and S-waves has important implications for earthquake signals propagating through fluid-bearing fractured rocks (volcanic areas, fluid-reservoirs) or for seismic exploration surveys in fractured reservoir situations.",10.1190/geo2013-0093.1
High‐Resolution Crosswell Imaging Of A West Texas Carbonate Reservoir: Part 1—Project Summary And Interpretation,"A carbon dioxide flood pilot is being conducted in a section of Chevron's McElroy field in Crane County, west Texas. Prior to CO2 injection, two high‐frequency crosswell seismic profiles were recorded to investigate the use of seismic profiling for high‐resolution reservoir delineation and CO2 monitoring. These preinjection profiles provide the baseline for time‐lapse monitoring. Profile #1 was recorded between an injector well and an offset observation well at a nominal well‐to‐well distance of 184 ft (56 m). Profile #2 was recorded between a producing well and the observation well at a nominal distance of 600 ft (183 m). The combination of traveltime tomography and stacked CDP reflection amplitudes demonstrates how high‐frequency crosswell seismic data can be used to image both large and small scale heterogeneity between wells: Transmission traveltime tomography is used to image the large scale velocity variations; CDP reflection imaging is then used to image smaller scale impedance heterogeneities. The resolution capability of crosswell data is clearly illustrated by an image of the Grayburg‐San Andres angular unconformity, seen in both the P‐wave and S‐wave velocity tomograms and the reflection images. In addition to the imaging study, cores from an observation well were analyzed to support interpretation of the crosswell images and assess the feasibility of monitoring changes in CO2 saturation. The results of this integrated study demonstrate (1) the use of crosswell seismic profiling to produce a high‐resolution reservoir delineation and (2) the possibility for successful monitoring of CO2 in carbonate reservoirs. The crosswell data were acquired with a piezoelectric source and a multilevel hydrophone array. Both profiles, nearly 80 000 seismic traces, were recorded in approximately 80 hours using a new acquisition technique of shooting on‐the‐fly. This paper presents the overall project summary and interpretation of the results from the near‐offset profile.",10.1190/1.1443806
Refraction Data From Single‐Ended Refraction Profiles,"Subsurface layer thicknesses and velocities may be obtained from reverse refraction profiles or by special groupings of traces which effectively fabricate synthetic reverse profiles. Especially in offshore areas, and elsewhere, single‐ended profiles are normally used for data gathering. A method for determining refraction information directly from these single‐ended profiles has been developed, which eliminates the need for special field procedures or data handling when refraction information is desired. A comparison of the expected errors from this and the conventional method is given. Finally, an example of static corrections derived by applying this method to the first arrivals of ordinary reflection data is shown.",10.1190/1.1440428
Bottom‐Simulating Reflectors: Seismic Velocities And Avo Effects,"We obtain the wave velocities of ice‐ and gas hydrate‐bearing sediments as a function of concentration and temperature. Unlike previous theories based on simple slowness and/or moduli averaging or two‐phase models, we use a Biot‐type three‐phase theory that considers the existence of two solids (grain and ice or clathrate) and a liquid (water), and a porous matrix containing gas and water. For consolidated Berea sandstone, the theory underestimates the value of the compressional velocity below 0°C. Including grain‐ice interactions and grain cementation yields a good fit to the experimental data. Strictly speaking, water proportion and temperature are closely related. Fitting the wave velocity at a given temperature allows the prediction of the velocity throughout the range of temperatures, provided that the average pore radius and its standard deviation are known. The reflection coefficients are computed with a viscoelastic single‐phase constitutive model. The analysis is carried out for the top and bottom of a free‐gas zone beneath a gas hydrate‐bearing sediment and overlying a sediment fully saturated with water. Assuming that the bottom‐simulating reflector is caused solely by an interface separating cemented gas hydrate‐ and free gas‐bearing sediments, we conclude that (1) for a given gas saturation, it is difficult to evaluate the amount of gas hydrate at low concentrations. However, low and high concentrations of hydrate can be distinguished, since they give positive and negative anomalies, respectively. (2) Saturation of free gas can be determined from the reflection amplitude, but not from the type of anomaly. (3) The P to S reflection coefficient is a good indicator of high amounts of free gas and gas hydrate. On the other hand, the amplitude‐variation‐with‐offset curves are always positive for uncemented sediments.",10.1190/1.1444725
Characterization Of Geothermal Reservoir Crack Patterns Using Shear‐Wave Splitting,"Microearthquakes recorded by a downhole, three‐component seismic network deployed around the Coso, California, geothermal reservoir since 1992 display distinctive shear‐wave splitting and clear polarization directions. From the polarizations we estimated three predominant subsurface fracture directions, and from the time delays of the split waves we determined tomographically the 3-D fracture density distribution in the reservoir.",10.1190/1.1444159
Elastic Wave Solutions In Stratified Media,"Classical Thomson‐Haskell methods are proven applicable to the asymptotic wave solution in a stratified elastic medium which has both first and second order discontinuities in ρ, λ, and μ. This proof removes a weakness of the original method, which made it unsatisfactory for modeling velocity gradient anomalies. The generalized method, simple in application for a stack of inhomogeneous layers, is used here to derive P-SV reflection/conversion/transmission properties for a transition region in which ρ, [(λ+2μ)/ρ]1/2, and (μ/ρ)1/2 vary linearly. Although the solution method is approximate, its accuracy is confirmed by comparison with exact solutions.",10.1190/1.1440216
Imaging Reflection-Blind Areas Using Transmitted Ps-Waves,"We illustrate the use of mode-converted transmitted (e.g., PS- or SP-) waves in vertical seismic profiling (VSP) data for imaging areas above receivers where reflected waves cannot illuminate. Three depth-domain imaging techniques — move-out correction, common-depth-point (CDP) mapping, and prestack migration — are described and used for imag-ing the transmitted waves. Moveout correction converts an offset VSP trace into a zero-offset trace. CDP mapping maps each sample on an input trace to the location where the mode conversion occurs. For complex media, prestack migration (e.g., reverse-time migration) is used. By using both synthetic and field VSP data, we demonstrate that images derived from transmissions complement those from reflections. As an important application, we show that transmitted waves can illuminate zones above highly de-viated or horizontal wells, a region not imaged by reflection data. Because all of these benefits are obtained without extra data acquisition cost, we believe transmission imag-ing techniques will become widely adopted by the oil in-dustry.",10.1190/1.2358415
Kirchhoff Migration Using Eikonal-Based Computation Of Traveltime Source Derivatives,"The computational efficiency of Kirchhoff-type migration can be enhanced by using accurate traveltime interpolation algorithms. We addressed the problem of interpolating between a sparse source sampling by using the derivative of traveltime with respect to the source location. We adopted a first-order partial differential equation that originates from differentiating the eikonal equation to compute the traveltime source derivatives efficiently and conveniently. Unlike methods that rely on finite-difference estimations, the accuracy of the eikonal-based derivative did not depend on input source sampling. For smooth velocity models, the first-order traveltime source derivatives enabled a cubic Hermite traveltime interpolation that took into consideration the curvatures of local wavefronts and can be straightforwardly incorporated into Kirchhoff antialiasing schemes. We provided an implementation of the proposed method to first-arrival traveltimes by modifying the fast-marching eikonal solver. Several simple synthetic models and a semirecursive Kirchhoff migration of the Marmousi model demonstrated the applicability of the proposed method.",10.1190/geo2012-0375.1
Offset‐Amplitude Variation And Controlled‐Amplitude Processing,"The partition of plane seismic waves at plane interfaces introduces changes in seismic amplitude which vary with angle of incidence. These amplitude variations are a function of the elastic parameters of rocks on either side of the interface. Controlled‐amplitude processing is designed to obtain the true amplitude information which is geologic in origin. The offset‐amplitude information may be successfully used to predict the fluid type in reservoir sands. Various tests were carried out on a seismic profile from the Gulf Coast. The processing comparison emphasized the effects and pitfalls of trace equalization, coherent noise, offset, and surface‐related problems. Two wells drilled at amplitude anomaly locations confirmed the prediction of hydrocarbons from offset‐amplitude analysis. Furthermore, controlled‐amplitude processing provided clues in evaluating reservoir quality, which was not evident on the conventional relative amplitude data.",10.1190/1.1441890
Numerical Modeling And Laboratory Measurements Of Seismic Attenuation In Partially Saturated Rock,"To better understand the effects of fluid saturation on seismic attenuation, we combined numerical modeling in poroelastic media and laboratory measurements of seismic attenuation in partially saturated Berea sandstone samples. Although in laboratory experiments many physical mechanisms for seismic attenuation take place simultaneously, with numerical modeling we separately studied the effect of a single physical mechanism: wave-induced fluid flow on the mesoscopic scale. Using the finite-element method, we solved Biot's equations of consolidation by performing a quasistatic creep test on a 3D poroelastic model. This model represents a partially saturated rock sample. We obtained the stress-strain relation, from which we calculated frequency-dependent attenuation. In the laboratory, we measured attenuation in extensional mode for dry and partially water-saturated Berea sandstone samples in the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 Hz. All the measurements were performed at room pressure and temperature conditions. From numerical simulations, we found that attenuation varies significantly with fluid distribution within the model. In addition to binary distributions, we used spatially continuous distributions of fluid saturation for the numerical models. Such continuous saturation distribution was implemented using properties of an effective single-phase fluid. By taking into account the matrix anelasticity, we found that wave-induced fluid flow on the mesoscopic scale due to a continuous distribution of fluid saturation can reproduce seismic attenuation data measured in a partially saturated sample. The matrix anelasticity was the attenuation measured in the room-condition dry sample.",10.1190/geo2013-0020.1
Effect Of Well Casings On Surface Electrical Surveys,"Surface electrical surveys are being used as alternative oil exploration tools in both developed and frontier areas. We have examined the resistivity‐IP response of steel oil well casings, which are common in developed oil fields. Two numerical models were constructed: a solution of Laplace's equation in the spatial wavenumber domain, and an integral equation approach using the Galerkin weighted residual technique, which simulate hollow, infinite‐length cylinders and finite‐length cylindrical shells, respectively, embedded in a uniform half‐space. Induced‐polarization effects can be simulated in these models by including a complex, frequency‐dependent surface impedance on the outer surface of the cylinder. Significant anomalies are generated by pipes having physically realistic dimensions and conductivities. Important parameters governing the response are the longitudinal conductance, length and radius of the pipe, and the number of pipes and their distances from the survey line. Comparison of field data with model results suggests that a significant part of the observed response may be due to well casings. However, more complicated models including electrical connections at the surface and earth layering are required before accurate modeling of many situations will be possible.",10.1190/1.1441649
Cooperative Inversion Of 2D Geophysical Data Sets: A Zonal Approach Based On Fuzzy C-Means Cluster Analysis,"In many near-surface geophysical applications, it is now common practice to use multiple geophysical methods to explore subsurface structures and parameters. Such multimethod-based exploration strategies can significantly reduce uncertainties and ambiguities in geophysical data analysis and interpretation. We propose a novel 2D approach based on fuzzy   c  -means cluster analysis for the cooperative inversion of disparate data sets. We show that this approach results in a single zonal model of subsurface structures in which each zone is characterized by a set of different parameters. This finding implies that no further structural interpretation of geophysical parameter fields is needed, which is a major advantage compared with conventional inversions that rely on a single input data set and cooperative inversion approaches.",10.1190/1.2670341
Electrolyte Activity: Its Effect On Induced Polarization,"Induced polarization (IP) occurs at metal‐solution and membrane‐solution interfaces in rock materials. Minerals producing significant IP include sulfides, magnetite (electrode polarization), and some clays (membrane polarization). In mineral exploration, one is concerned with the distinction between these two phenomena; either may be significant, but together they are confusing. While no practical means has yet been devised to do this in the field, one may exist. The present study represents the first stage in an attempt to elucidate the phenomena and to make such a distinction. There is no means of studying directly the effect of variables on polarization at a single interface or cell in a rock if those variables also affect rock resistivity. Hence, one must speak of rock IP independently of individual cell IP. Data reported herein reflect rock IP. Temperature and pressure appear to have little effect on IP of specimens studied so far; further investigation may show that they are important in some geologic environments. Changes in electrolyte activity greatly influence rock IP. Membrane and disseminated electrode polarization decrease while connected (veined) electrode IP increases with increasing activity. This fact may be useful in interpretation of depth variations of IP in the field, particularly over oxidizing sulfide bodies.",10.1190/1.1439079
Integrated Radon Monitoring By The Diffusional Barrier Technique,"In many searches for uranium in the earth by mapping of 222Rn it is difficult or inconvenient to drill conventional holes approximately 60 cm in depth. A simpler and more economical method is to use a mat to create a diffusional barrier to radon at the surface and monitor radon beneath the mat. Theory gives the effective depth to which radon is sampled as a function of mat radius, the relation being linear for radii that are small relative to the mean diffusion distance of the radon. Calculations based on this theory indicate what barrier properties are needed. For solubilities of radon that are below 100, a polyethylene mat thickness of at least 50 μm gives a barrier efficiency of more than 90 percent. Field experiments at two sites demonstrate that the predicted variation with mat radius occurs and that measurements are reproducible.",10.1190/1.1440950
The Effect Of Mud Resistivities On The Intensities Of Electrical Logs,The drilling mud is one of the variables that prevents comparing the actual intensities of electrical logs. This paper deals with the effect of the resistivity of the drilling mud on the intensities of the natural potential and normal apparent resistivity curves.,10.1190/1.1444996
Fundamental Relations In Seismometry,"The equations for dynamical equilibrium of a geophone are derived by means of the Lagrange method and applied to the particular cases of a moving armature geophone, moving conductor geophone, and electrostatic geophone. The galvanometer for seismic recording is usually of the moving coil type and its equations are similar to those of a moving conductor geophone. The magnetic type geophone as well as the galvanometer consist essentially of two dynamical systems characterized by an asymmetric coupling: ""the transducing resistance."" A brief analysis is given of the problem of determining the response of a seismograph to a given earth motion.",10.1190/1.1438084
Frequency Domain Least‐Squares Inversion Of Thick Dike Magnetic Anomalies Using Marquardt Algorithm,"The elegance and ease with which the Fourier transformation method can be employed in the interpretation of potential field geophysical data (Dean, 1958; Gudmundsson, 1966) has resulted in the formulation of a number of frequency‐domain approaches for interpreting the magnetic effects of specific source geometries, e.g., Bhattacharyya (1966), Sengupta (1974), Sengupta and Das (1975), Bhattacharyya and Leu (1975, 1977), etc. In these techniques, the parameters of interest are estimated from the characteristics of the amplitude and phase spectra, a process that is often beset with several problems which adversely affect the estimation of parameters. These problems arise partly from the ill‐defined nature of characteristic points in the spectra, either due to spectral noise or due to inadequate digitization spacing, and partly from the fact that the errors in the estimation of certain parameters which are used for subsequent estimation of the other parameters usually cause added spectral distortions. Rao et al. (1978) advocated the use of end corrections to overcome these problems. An effective alternative would be to incorporate the least‐squares method in the interpretational process. This necessitates iteration owing to the nonlinear nature of equations relating the source parameters and the Fourier spectra of corresponding anomalies. While it is tempting to employ the iteration scheme formulated by Gauss in 1821 for this purpose, as has indeed been done in a number of space‐domain approaches (e.g., Hall, 1958; Bosum, 1968; Al‐Chalabi, 1970; Rao et al., 1973; Won, 1981), the convergence in this approach requires the initially assumed values of the parameters to be very close to the final solution. The steepest descent method, an alternative to this, has an extremely slow convergence. It is shown here, with the example of a two‐dimensional (2-D) structure, that Marquardt's algorithm (Marquardt, 1963), which offers a compromise between these two iteration schemes and has been effectively employed by Johnson (1969) and Pedersen (1977) in their space‐domain interpretation schemes, provides an efficient approach to accomplish the iteration in the case of frequency‐domain magnetic interpretation.",10.1190/1.1441181
Seismic Reflection Techniques For Crustal Structure Studies,"A wide‐angle reflection/refraction survey, conducted near Yellowknife, N.W.T., Canada has revealed a complex crust in contrast to the simple model indicated by a large‐scale refraction survey. A near‐vertical reflection survey, conducted in north‐central British Columbia, using dynamite detonated in a shallow lake, recorded coherent energy at two‐way times of up to 11 sec. A reflector at a depth of 30–35 km is thus indicated which corresponds to a refraction‐determined Moho depth for the area. CRP stacking attempts have been unsuccessful for both of these surveys due mainly to the complex overburden encountered but possibly due in part to the nature of the deep reflectors themselves. A reflector comprised of a series of thin layers of alternating high and low velocities will produce a composite reflected pulse, whose amplitude, frequency content, and apparent arrival time will change as the reflecting angle changes. Successful application of the CRP method would require restricting its use to a much narrower range of incident angles than we have employed. A Vibroseis survey, duplicating the coverage of the B.C. reflection profile, indicated the same reflector at 11 sec. The Vibroseis section remains superior despite exhaustive attempts at enhancement of the dynamite‐produced data.",10.1190/1.1440679
"A Short And Straightforward Derivation Of Two Equations From Hubral'S Paper ""Computing True Amplitude Reflections In A Laterally Inhomogeneous Earth""","In his important paper ""Computing true amplitude reflections in a laterally inhomogeneous earth"" (Hubral, 1983, this issue) the author derives the fundamental equation ",10.1190/1.1441535
Elastic Wave Modeling With Free Surfaces: Stability Of Long Simulations,"Three‐dimensional (3D) elastic wave propagation modeling in the velocity‐stress formulation using finite differences (FDs) have been investigated for a homogeneous medium covered by a representative, relatively steep surface topography consisting of a 1D square root function. This scenario using various numerical implementations is explored. The behavior with regard to stability of long simulations is expected to be indicative of each numerical implementation's robustness for other types of topographies/media. Employing various combinations of the FD order was found only to change the time of the first incidence of instability. On the other hand, nonequidistant grids in the horizontal and vertical directions are found to be extremely useful for long‐term stability of 3D wave propagation modeling with our free‐surface boundary condition for single‐valued topographies. In particular dz ≥ (3/2) dx is found completely stable for all tested vP/vS ratios. Such relationships of using dz  dx are also favorable for more accurate Rayleigh‐wave modeling. Setting the density equal to 1/10 of its interior value at one layer only at the surface is another simple means of achieving stability.",10.1190/1.1543217
A Wraparound Elimination Technique For The Pseudospectral Wave Synthesis Using An Antiperiodic Extension Of The Wavefield,"The pseudospectral method (e.g., Kosloff and Baysal, 1982) is an attractive alternative to numerical modeling schemes such as finite difference or finite element because it requires several orders of magnitude less computer memory and computation time. In the pseudospectral method, the field variables are expanded in terms of Fourier interpolation polynomials which impose periodic boundary conditions on the equation of motion. Numerical differentiation is then implemented via the discrete Fourier transform. The periodicity condition causes the periodically extended wavefield on either side of the computational domain to propagate in from the sides, interfering with the actual solution. This phenomenon is called wraparound. In many current applications (e.g., Cerjan et al., 1985), an absorbing boundary condition has been used to damp the wraparound phases through a gradual reduction of the wavefield amplitude in the vicinity of the grid boundary. Such a method works effectively when the appropriate absorption coefficients are used. However, improper selection of absorption parameters can result in reflected waves of relatively large amplitude. Thus a major disadvantage of such methods is the difficulty of selecting appropriate damping parameters to suppress both the wraparound and the boundary reflected phases.",10.1190/1.1443760
Prestack Wavefield Approximations,"The double-square-root (DSR) relation offers a platform to perform prestack imaging using an extended single wavefield that honors the geometrical configuration between sources, receivers, and the image point, or in other words, prestack wavefields. Extrapolating such wavefields, nevertheless, suffers from limitations. Chief among them is the singularity associated with horizontally propagating waves. I have devised highly accurate approximations free of such singularities which are highly accurate. Specifically, I use Padé expansions with denominators given by a power series that is an order lower than that of the numerator, and thus, introduce a free variable to balance the series order and normalize the singularity. For the higher-order Padé approximation, the errors are negligible. Additional simplifications, like recasting the DSR formula as a function of scattering angle, allow for a singularity free form that is useful for constant-angle-gather imaging. A dynamic form of this DSR formula can be supported by kinematic evaluations of the scattering angle to provide efficient prestack wavefield construction. Applying a similar approximation to the dip angle yields an efficient 1D wave equation with the scattering and dip angles extracted from, for example, DSR ray tracing. Application to the complex Marmousi data set demonstrates that these approximations, although they may provide less than optimal results, allow for efficient and flexible implementations.",10.1190/geo2012-0532.1
Dielectric Permittivity Of Fine-Grained Fractions Of Soil Samples From Eastern Spain At 200 Mhz ,"To provide a database for interpreting GPR field data by means of small-scale laboratory studies, we have determined the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity of fine-grained fractions of soil samples from eastern Spain in the laboratory. We use the parallel-plate method in combination with an impedance analyzer and focus on the frequency of   200 MHz  . The measurements are compared to physical properties such as volumetric water content, dry density, clay fraction, and carbonate content. The results show the well-known increase in dielectric permittivity with increasing water content, as presented in the literature; however, our values are systematically higher. This deviation may be caused by the exceptionally high carbonate content of the samples. We establish a basic relationship between dielectric permittivity and water content that is characteristic for soils in the research area. In addition to the dominating influence of water on permittivity, we find a correlation with dry density as well, which is linear for dry samples. Finally, we calculate the attenuation coefficients and find high attenuation for samples with high clay fraction, even at low water contents. A 1D model of the permittivity distribution is constructed from borehole data (water content and layer thickness) coincident with a GPR profile and from the laboratory data. The modeled GPR trace explains the observation and thus connects laboratory measurements to GPR data.",10.1190/1.3294859
"A Study Of Fuzzy C-Means Coupling For Joint Inversion, Using Seismic Tomography And Gravity Data Test Scenarios","Joint inversion, the inversion of multiple geophysical data sets containing complementary information about the subsurface, has the potential to significantly improve inversion results by reducing the nonuniqueness of the inverse problem. One of the challenges of joint inversion is deciding how to couple the multiple physical property models. If a coupling approach is used that is inconsistent with the physical truth, then inversion artifacts can occur and may lead to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we investigated the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering approach to provide a lithological coupling of the seismic velocity and density models in joint 2D inversions of first-arrival traveltimes and gravity data. Even though this coupling approach has been used in previous works, recommendations for its effective use have not yet been developed. We conducted a suite of joint inversion tests on synthetic data generated from a geologically realistic model based on magmatic massive sulfide deposits. There is a known relationship between seismic velocity and density for the silicate rocks and sulfide minerals involved; this lithological relationship was used to design a clustered coupling strategy in the joint inversions. The tests we conducted clearly exhibited the benefits of joint inversion using FCM coupling. Our work revealed the effects of including inaccurate a priori physical property information. We also evaluated approaches to assess whether such inaccurate information may have been used.",10.1190/geo2014-0056.1
Verification Of Five Magnetotelluric Systems In The Mini‐Emslab Experiment,"Given the degree of complexity of modern magnetotelluric (MT) instrumentation, comparison of the total performance for two or more systems is an important verification test. This paper compares the processed data from five MT systems which were designed and constructed separately, and which employ different electrode types, electrode separations, magnetometers, and methods of signal processing. The comparison shows that there is a high degree of agreement among the data from the different systems. The study also demonstrates the compatibility and reliability of the MT systems employed as part of EMSLAB Juan de Fuca (Electromagnetic Sounding of the Lithosphere and Asthenosphere Beneath the Juan de Fuca Plate). This project, proposed by a consortium of institutions, involves not only magnetotellurics studies but also studies of magnetic variation, on land and on the sea bottom. The project calls for the real‐time MT systems to occupy stations along segments of a profile in Oregon. A composite profile will be created from the segments. Prior to commencing the main MT profiling phase, one week was set aside in August, 1984, for all groups to record and process MT data sequentially at six sites in diverse geologic terrains; this experiment was called mini‐EMSLAB.",10.1190/1.1442487
Variation Of Elastic Wave Velocities In Basic Igneous Rocks With Pressure And Temperature,"The dilatational and rotational wave velocities have been measured as functions of pressure and temperature for three gabbros, two basalts and a dunite. The pressure range was 200–6,000 bars. The temperature range was 25° to 300°C. and 400°C. for one sample. The maximum pressure is equivalent to 23 km of depth and the highest temperature is believed to correspond to 25 km. The data indicate a tendency for the velocity to reach a maximum somewhere between 10 and 20 km and then decrease slightly.",10.1190/1.1438332

"Low‐Frequency Impedance Parameters Of Basalt, Granite, And Quartzite","An analog circuit digital computer setup was used to evaluate rock electrical impedance and phase angle in the frequency range 0.05 to 2 khz. Room‐temperature measurements were made on several samples of basalt, granite, and quartz. Argand diagram presentation of rock reactance as a function of its resistance at a series of frequencies described a semicircular arc. Rock impedance circular arcs can be used to define the rock resistivity at infinite frequency and the dc resistivity at the limit of zero frequency. Variation of rock resistance with the logarithm of frequency indicated finite rock dielectric dispersions at characteristic frequency ranges. Also, variation of rock reactance with the logarithm of frequency exhibited finite relaxation peaks, which can be used to difine the rock characteristics or turnover frequency as well as a characteristic or relaxation time.",10.1190/1.1440335
A Standard Quantitative Calibration Procedure For Marine Seismic Sources,"Marine source evaluation has traditionally been a subjective and qualitative study. This is particularly true in the case of source spectral characteristics. As a result, source evaluation, development, and array design based on seismic energy over a specified frequency band have been impossible. Further, the transient nature of source wavelets lends itseft to energy analysis rather than the traditional relative power analysis. The methodology required to achieve a calibrated quantitative estimate of marine seismic source energy is detailed here. The procedure involves two steps. First, a calibrated high‐fidelity measurement of the source signature is required; and second, an analysis of the signatures by a suite of computer algorithms designed to extract quantified measures of amplitude and energy is necessary. Results of the analysis include a time‐domain signature calibrated in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) units of pressure and a frequency domain spectrum calibrated in ANSI units of energy flux. These results provide figures of merit for evaluation of individual source characteristics (e.g., energy flux over seismic bandwidth, and total source energy). Additionally, the results provide data for a quantitative comparison of any two or more sources. Illustrative examples of source studies are included.",10.1190/1.1441842
Reflection Technique In Time‐Frequency Domain Using Multicomponent Acoustic Emission Signals And Application To Geothermal Reservoirs,"We have developed a reflection technique for estimating deep geothermal reservoir structures using acoustic emission signals as a source, which is useful when there is no proper estimating technique because of high temperature, high pressure, and great depth. Because its resolution is not high enough for comparison with methods such as well logging, we have enhanced the technique by developing a time–frequency‐domain analysis of multicomponent acoustic emission signals using a wavelet transform. The reflected wave is separated from an incoherent coda by analyzing the shape of a 3‐D hodogram: a linear shape indicates the arrival of a coherent signal such as a reflected wave, and an incoherent signal such as a coda makes a spherical shape. We construct a spectral matrix of 3‐D particle motion using a wavelet transform, as is done in a time–frequency domain. We evaluate the linearity of the 3‐D hodogram for each time and frequency by using the eigenvalues of the spectral matrix. Three‐dimensional inversion of the distribution of hodogram linearity in the time–frequency domain lets us image the deep subsurface structure. The inversion is based on the diffraction stack. We reduce the uncertainties by investigating S‐wave polarization direction, and we compensate for inhomogeneous source distribution to get reliable estimates with high resolution. We then evaluate our methods with synthetic signals. We discriminate a coherent wave from incoherent random noise in the presence of an S/N ratio of −3.7 dB and detect reflectors at correct depths with a small number of detectors. We apply the method to data from the European hot, dry rock site in Soultz‐sous‐Forêts, France, and compare our estimates with those from a number of borehole observations. The detected reflectors agree with the location of fracture zones. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method for detecting reflectors at great depths.",10.1190/1.1484535
Hammer Reflection Seismics In Engineering Geophysics,"A major problem in exploiting the reflection method in engineering geophysics lies in the difficulty of separating the various superimposed arrivals at short record times. Velocity filtering is used in the present study as a means of identifying the reflection arrivals by removing the undesirable waves and leaving a substantially usable reflection record, even at very short record times. Special circuitry has been developed to sense the time lag of positive zero crossings of the signal at two separate geophones, and to record only those arrivals whose phase shift is smaller than an arbitrarily set amount. This circuitry has been incorporated into a standard hammer‐type engineering seismograph. Fundamentals of analysis of an expanding reflection spread are reviewed, and field examples are shown to demonstrate the abilities and limitations of the present technique.",10.1190/1.1440017
Field Of An Alternating Magnetic Dipole On The Surface Of A Layered Earth,"The magnetic field near a vertical alternating magnetic dipole on the surface of a layered earth is computed for points on the surface. In the layer the dimensionless conductivity parameter is assumed to take the values 0, 14, 1, and 4; in the homogeneous substratum, this parameter is assigned the values 0, 14, 1, 4, and infinity. The induced field is computed at distances from the source 12, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 times the layer thickness.",10.1190/1.1438570
Scalar Imaging Condition For Elastic Reverse Time Migration,"Polarity changes in converted-wave images constructed by elastic reverse time migration cause destructive interference after stacking over the experiments of a seismic survey. This polarity reversal is due to PS and SP reflectivities reversing sign at certain incidence angles, e.g., at normal incidence in isotropic media. Many of the available polarity correction methods are complex and require costly transformations, e.g., to the angle domain. We derive a simple imaging condition for converted waves to correct the image polarity and reveal the conversion strength from one wave mode to another. Our imaging condition exploits pure P- and S-modes obtained by Helmholtz decomposition. Instead of correlating Cartesian components of the vector S-mode with the P-mode, we exploit all three components of the S wavefield at once to produce a unique image. We generate PS and SP images using geometric relationships among the propagation directions for the P- and S-wavefields, the reflector orientation, and the S-mode polarization direction. Compared with alternative methods for correcting the polarity reversal of PS and SP images, our imaging condition is simple and robust and does not significantly increase the cost of reverse time migration. Several numerical examples were used to test the effectiveness of our new imaging condition using simple and complex models.",10.1190/geo2014-0453.1
Full-Wavefield Modeling And Reverse Time Migration Of Laser Ultrasound Data: A Feasibility Study,"Laser ultrasound (LU) data acquired on cylindrical core samples effectively probe the physical properties of geologic materials. Although most LU analyses focus on estimating and inverting traveltimes of direct arrivals, it is important to recognize that LU data sets can have rich wavefield coda and can now be acquired with a sufficient spatial density to enable the application of exploration seismic full-wavefield techniques such as reverse time migration (RTM) and, potentially, full-waveform inversion (FWI). We have developed a feasibility study that examines the applicability of 2D acoustic forward modeling and 2D RTM analyses on laboratory LU data acquired on cylindrical polymer samples. Forward-modeled waveforms from our numerical tests matched the kinematics of the LU body waves measured through homogeneous samples, as well as the scattered wavefield generated by fractures induced in an otherwise-homogeneous medium. The scattered wavefield is then used in an RTM scheme to directly image millimeter-scale fracture structure.",10.1190/geo2015-0020.1
"Macroscopic Framework For Viscoelasticity, Poroelasticity, And Wave-Induced Fluid Flows — Part 1: General Linear Solid","Field and laboratory observations of seismic wave propagation and attenuation are usually explained using the viscoelastic (VE) model and effective moduli. However, in sedimentary rocks, wave velocities and attenuation rates are dominated by pore-fluid effects, such as poroelasticity, squirt, and mesoscopic wave-induced fluid flows. Physically, such effects are significantly different from viscoelasticity, and the pore-fluid and VE phenomena are difficult to compare quantitatively without a common theoretical framework. We develop such a unified macroscopic framework that we call the general linear solid (GLS). The GLS is based on Lagrangian continuum mechanics, and it can be summarized as multiphase poroelasticity extended by solid and fluid viscosities. The formulation is carried out strictly in terms of continuum mechanics, measurable physical properties, and boundary conditions, from which the observable wave velocities and attenuation are predicted. Explicit differential equations are derived in matrix form, from which a variety of numerical modeling schemes can be obtained. A rigorous correspondence principle is formulated, in which viscosity effects contribute to complex-valued VE moduli, and Darcy friction lead to a complex-valued density matrix. Within the GLS framework, the viscoelasticity represents an end member characterized by zero Darcy-type friction, whereas the poroelasticity is an end member with zero solid viscosity. Transitions between these end members and their extensions yield macroscopic models of viscoporoelasticity, poroelasticity with multiple saturating fluids and double porosity, and poroelasticity with squirt flows. The approach is illustrated on models of layered poroelastic and viscoporoelastic media. Applications of the GLS framework are continued in part 2 of this study.",10.1190/geo2014-0171.1
Estimating Vp/Vs Ratios Using Smooth Dynamic Image Warping,"Multicomponent seismic images are composed of different combinations of downgoing and upgoing wavefields. Each wave mode has different propagation velocity and polarization direction and thus carries unique, direction-dependent information about the subsurface. Differences in propagation velocity cause events in converted-wave or PS images to appear at later times than the P-wave or PP image counterparts. Reflectivities are different for each wave mode, and therefore, multicomponent images are not related simply by time shifts. These complications historically required that the alignment, also called registration, of corresponding image features be done manually, which is a tedious process. To register PP and PS images automatically, we used a smooth dynamic image-warping algorithm that can be accurate with respect to problems unrelated to time shifts, such as differences in noise and reflection waveforms. Interval VP/VS ratios can be estimated from derivatives of vertical shifts that align reflections in PP and PS images. To optimize accuracy of estimated time shifts and VP/VS ratios, we automatically constructed a coarse lattice of points located on reflections with high amplitudes and then estimated time shifts at only those image samples. By adjusting the coarseness of the lattice, we trade off resolution of changes in VP/VS with increased accuracy in VP/VS estimates. By processing 3D PP and PS images, we learned that our estimates of VP/VS cannot be obtained by smoothing time shifts estimated at every image sample.",10.1190/geo2014-0022.1
A Hybrid Finite-Difference And Integral-Equation Method For Modeling And Inversion Of Marine Controlled-Source Electromagnetic Data,"One of the major problems in the modeling and inversion of marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data is related to the need for accurate representation of very complex geoelectrical models typical for marine environment. At the same time, the corresponding forward-modeling algorithms should be powerful and fast enough to be suitable for repeated use in hundreds of iterations of the inversion and for multiple transmitter/receiver positions. To this end, we have developed a novel 3D modeling and inversion approach, which combines the advantages of the finite-difference (FD) and integral-equation (IE) methods. In the framework of this approach, we have solved Maxwell's equations for anomalous electric fields using the FD approximation on a staggered grid. Once the unknown electric fields in the computation domain of the FD method are computed, the electric and magnetic fields at the receivers are calculated using the IE method with the corresponding Green's tensor for the background conductivity model. This approach makes it possible to compute the fields at the receivers accurately without the need of very fine FD discretization in the vicinity of the receivers and sources and without the need for numerical differentiation and interpolation. We have also developed an algorithm for 3D inversion based on the hybrid FD-IE method. In the case of the marine CSEM problem with multiple transmitters and receivers, the forward modeling and the Fréchet derivative calculations are very time consuming and require using large memory to store the intermediate results. To overcome those problems, we have applied the moving sensitivity domain approach to our inversion. A case study for the 3D inversion of towed streamer EM data collected by PGS over the Troll field in the North Sea demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed hybrid method.",10.1190/geo2015-0513.1
Accuracy And Effectiveness Of Three-Dimensional Controlled Source Electromagnetic Data Inversions,"Unconstrained 3D inversion of marine controlled source electromagnetic data (CSEM) data sets produces resistivity volumes that have an uncertain relationship to the true subsurface resistivity at the scale of typical hydrocarbon reservoirs. Furthermore, CSEM-scale resistivity is an ambiguous indicator of hydrocarbon presence; not all resistivity anomalies are caused by hydrocarbon reservoirs, and not all hydrocarbon reservoirs produce a distinct resistivity anomaly. We have developed a method for quantifying the effectiveness of resistivities from CSEM inversion in detecting hydrocarbon reservoirs. Our approach uses probabilistic rock-physics modeling to update information from a preexisting prospect assessment, based on uncertain resistivities from CSEM. The result is an estimate the probability of hydrocarbon presence that accounts for uncertainty in the resistivity and in rock properties. Examples using synthetic and real CSEM data sets demonstrate that the effectiveness of CSEM inversion in identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs depends on the interaction between the uncertainty associated with the inversion-derived resistivity and the range of rock and fluid properties that were expected for the targeted prospect. Resistivity uncertainty that has a small effect on hydrocarbon probability for one set of rock property distributions may have a large effect for a different set of rock properties. Depending on the consequences of this interaction, resistivities from CSEM inversion might reduce the risk associated with predictions of hydrocarbon presence, but they cannot be expected to guarantee a specific well outcome.",10.1190/geo2014-0142.1
Interpretation Of Crone Pulse Electromagnetic Data,"Time‐domain electromagnetic (TEM) prospecting systems, including the Crone pulse electromagnetic (PEM) system, are becoming more widely used in the search for massive sulfides. We have developed interpretation aids for the moving‐source configuration of the Crone PEM system using the PLATE and SPHERE programs developed by the University of Toronto. PLATE models a thin rectangular sheet in free space and SPHERE models a two‐layer sphere in free space. The effects of varying the model parameters, particularly the dip, depth, and conductance for large plates, are shown. As the dip of a plate goes from 0 to 90 degrees, the negative side lobe over the conductor becomes less pronounced. The depth can be estimated from the amplitude of the positive peak over the edge of a conductor. The depth of exploration for the Crone PEM system is approximately twice the coil separation for shallow dipping plates, and one coil separation for steeply dipping plates when there is not a significant half‐space or overburden response. The ratio of the on‐conductor and off‐conductor side‐lobe areas gives an estimate of the dip if the depth of the target has been determined. The resolution of dip for plates dipping more than 60 degrees is poor. The conductance of a plate can be determined from either channel‐ratios or the estimated time constant. Channel‐ratios sometimes provide better estimates, because they have less dependence on the size of the conductor at earlier times. At early times, the target response can be obscured by conductive overburden. Only at late times would interpretation aids be useful in evaluating the target parameters. A dip‐depth nomogram and channel‐ratios gave good first estimates of the target parameters of three field examples interpreted by computer modeling.",10.1190/1.1442016
"""Unexpected"" Shear‐Wave Behavior","In a previous study, we inverted shear‐wave birefringence observations from an azimuthal vertical seismic profile (VSP) experiment conducted at the Conoco Borehole Test Facility, Oklahoma (Horne and MacBeth, 1994; Horne, 1995). Our results indicate that the observations can be interpreted in terms of two distinctly different transversely isotropic (TI) models (Figure 1). The first model predicts the symmetry axis to be at N165°E and dipping 10° to the northwest. This orientation coincides with geological information relating to the fracture system that strikes between N50°E and N75°E (Queen and Rizer, 1990). Thus, this first model is consistent with a priori information, so that a possible source of the anisotropy can be identified. However, the second model derived from the inversion results suggests the symmetry axis to be at N200°E and dipping 30° to the southwest. If we interpret this result in terms of an equivalent medium resulting from aligned cracks or fractures, then this inferred crack‐fracture strike would lie in a direction conflicting with the a priori measurements. The bimodal nature of this solution can be readily understood if we examine the shear‐wave behavior for the different models shown in Figure 2. In this plot, the symmetry axis is chosen to be the x1‐direction. If we consider the near‐vertical propagation directions that are typically measured in VSP experiments, it can be seen that the qS1 polarizations lie either perpendicular (model 1) or parallel (model 2) to the symmetry axis. Since these polarizations are usually interpreted in terms of aligned crack‐fracture systems, the inferred strike would lie in the x2x3 plane for model 1 and the x1x3 plane for model 2. This interpretation is completely incorrect for model 2, since this inferred alignment is actually orthogonal to the alignment implied by the symmetry of the TI system. This situation represents a worrying aspect to the interpretation of shear‐wave surveys used to characterize crack‐fracture systems. The question that we address is whether anisotropic materials that possess properties similar to those of model 2 can be constructed from equivalent media resulting from cracks or fractures. We also consider other sources of anisotropy that may lead to this behavior.",10.1190/1.1444288
"Geophysical History, Brehm Field, Pratt County, Kansas","The Brehm field, Pratt County, Kansas, was discovered in October, 1961, after a detailed seismic survey following a subsurface lead. Developed production is from the Arbuckle, Simpson, and Lansing. Production to date is about three hundred thousand bbl of oil plus about one billion cu ft of gas. Estimated reserves are four to six million bbl of oil.",10.1190/1.1439684
Centroid Phase Slowness As A Tool For Dispersion Correction Of Dipole Acoustic Logging Data,We develop a simple and efficient method for correcting the borehole flexural‐wave slowness dispersion effects. We demonstrate its validity on synthetic and field data. The theory underlying the method is derived from first principles and shows the general result that semblance‐derived wave slowness is a spectral‐amplitude weighted average of the wave‐slowness dispersion curve. The theory also explains that a dispersion correction on the borehole flexural wave slowness is not necessary if the source frequency content is sufficiently low.,10.1190/1.1543197
Attenuation And Anisotropy Of Channel Waves In Coal Seams,"In recent years channel‐wave seismology has shown itself to be a useful aid to coal mining. Small geologic faults which interrupt a coal seam can seriously disrupt mining by modern longwall methods. Such features have been accurately predicted at distances of several hundred meters by underground seismic surveys. The useful range of the method in a particular seam depends critically on the rate at which channel waves in the frequency range of interest (50 to 500 Hz) are attenuated during passage through the coal; when no faulting is located by a given survey, it is always important to know at what range a fault would have been detected had it been present. To this end, the attenuation characteristics must be studied. Frequently, coal seams are highly anisotropic wave‐guides. Perpendicular to the bedding plane one or two ""cleat"" or cleavage planes exist, along which the coal is extensively cracked and jointed. Recent work by Crampin (1978, 1981) and by Hudson (1981) has shown that such systems of parallel cracks in crustal rocks lead to anisotropic propagation of body waves, with both velocity and attenuation varying considerably as a function of angle of travel through the cracked medium. The polarization of seismic energy propagating through such media can no longer be defined as simple shear or compression. It is reasonable to expect that guided channel waves in coal seams will exhibit similar properties. A number of transmission surveys have been carried out to investigate both attenuation and anisotropy. The principal requirement for such surveys is that in‐seam shot and geophone arrays be designed to provide a large range of both source‐detector distance and angle of travel through the coal. Given this condition, anisotropy of group velocity can be detected by adapting Dziewonski's multiple filter analysis of single traces to transmission stacking over selected raypath angles (Dziewonski et al, 1969); attenuation similarly can be investigated by a least‐squares regression of the logarithm of the amplitude spectrum of a particular mode onto the path length. The methods and results of these investigations are reported here, the significance of anisotropy for the collection and processing of in‐seam data is discussed, and consideration is given to the type and size of errors introduced into  the position of fault predictions made on the basis of an isotropic model. The equivalence of Fermat's principle and  Snell's law for anisotropic raypaths results in a computationally efficient modification to enable our previously reported dynamic trace gathering (DTG) stacking procedure to be used for such data.",10.1190/1.1441453
Approximate Inversion Of High‐Frequency Electromagnetic Soundings Using Complex Image Theory,"Electromagnetic (EM) soundings in an intermediate range between quasi‐static and radar frequencies (e.g., 30 kHz – 300 MHz) were studied with an approximate inversion method for shallow‐layered earth models using complex image theory. The half‐space image theory formulas for calculating forward soundings for any dipole source are easily extended to accommodate a multilayered earth, and only involve elementary complex functions. Approximate inversion using the modified image formulas is compared with more exact numerical integration inversion for horizontal‐layered models to yield the conductivity, thickness, and dielectric permittivity of each layer. A nonlinear least‐squares algorithm was used to obtain parameter and linear parameter error estimates. The results, using known exact forward models and one field data case, indicate that approximate image inversion is more than an order‐of‐magnitude faster than numerical integration inversion. However, approximate inversion could not always resolve deeper layer parameters as well as with exact inversion. Accuracy of both methods, however, depends on the frequency range used. Nevertheless, approximate inversion can be a useful quick reconnaissance tool, and could easily be written for on‐site personal computers.",10.1190/1.1443120
Maintaining An Adequate Level Of Geophysical Exploration,"At the time of the Denver meeting last year, many geologists and geophysicists were frankly in doubt as to where their duty lay in the war effort. This year there should be much less uncertainty as we have been given a task on the home front which will tax our resources to the utmost. The task, to locate 4500 wildcat wells so judiciously that neither steel nor manpower will be wasted in unjustified drilling. The facts which seem to make necessary this enormous wildcat drilling program in the face of a national shortage of critical materials and manpower have been widely publicized in the trade journals, and I will only briefly recapitulate them.",10.1190/1.1445042
3-D Resistivity Forward Modeling And Inversion Using Conjugate Gradients,"We have developed rapid 3-D dc resistivity forward modeling and inversion algorithms that use conjugate gradient relaxation techniques. In the forward network modeling calculation, an incomplete Cholesky decomposition for preconditioning and sparse matrix routines combine to produce a fast and efficient algorithm (approximately 2 minutes CPU time on a Sun SPARC‐station 2 for 50 × 50 × 20 blocks). The side and bottom boundary conditions are scaled impedance conditions that take into account the local current flow at the boundaries as a result of any configuration of current sources. For the inversion, conjugate gradient relaxation is used to solve the maximum likelihood inverse equations. Since conjugate gradient techniques only require the results of the sensitivity matrix A˜ or its transpose A˜T multiplying a vector, we are able to bypass the actual computation of the sensitivity matrix and the inversion of A˜TA˜, thus greatly decreasing the time needed to do 3-D inversions. We demonstrate 3-D resistivity tomographic imaging using pole‐pole resistivity data collected during an experiment for a leakage monitoring system near evaporation ponds at the Mojave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada.",10.1190/1.1443868
Formal Gravity Interpretation Over The 800-M Darai Escarpment In New Guinea,"A gravity traverse over the 800-m escarpment at Darai in New Guinea is analyzed using the formal interpretation approach in which processing and interpretation are combined in a fully computerized procedure. The topographic anomaly is computed by modeling the air‐rock interface, and the density of the escarpment is deduced from Nettleton's density profiles after making allowance for upward continuation. To aid in the analysis, synthetic density profiles are produced for escarpment models and for the real escarpment. The analysis shows that a fault is located near the base of the escarpment and the bulk density there is 2.2±.05g/cm3. There is no vertical continuation bump directly over the fault. The upthrown basement is at a depth of roughly 2500 m. The fault's position near the base of the escarpment suggests a history of repetitive crustal movements.",10.1190/1.1441372
Prediction Of Archie'S Cementation Factor From Porosity And Permeability Through Specific Surface,"Based on Archie's cementation factor as measured on North Sea chalk and on published data, we explore how the cementation factor depends on other physical properties of the chalk. A relationship between cementation factor and specific surface with respect to bulk volume is obtained for chalk. This leads to how Archie's cementation factor may be predicted from porosity and permeability for chalk as well as for sandstone. A common relationship between cementation factor and specific surface with respect to bulk volume calculated from porosity and permeability is obtained. As an alternative, the   a  -factor in Archie's equation is related to specific surface with respect to bulk volume, but the relationship is less clear than the simple relationship between cementation factor and specific surface.",10.1190/1.2837303
True‐Amplitude Imaging And Dip Moveout,"True‐amplitude seismic imaging produces a three dimensional (3-D) migrated section in which the peak amplitude of each migrated event is proportional to the reflectivity. For a constant‐velocity medium, the standard imaging sequence consisting of spherical‐divergence correction, normal moveout (NMO), dip moveout (DMO), and zero‐offset migration produces a true‐amplitude image if the DMO step is done correctly. There are two equivalent ways to derive the correct amplitude‐preserving DMO. The first is to improve upon Hale's derivation of F-K DMO by taking the reflection‐point smear properly into account. This yields a new Jacobian that simply replaces the Jacobian in Hale's method. The second way is to calibrate the filter that appears in integral DMO so as to preserve the amplitude of an arbitrary 3-D dipping reflector. This latter method is based upon the 3-D acoustic wave equation with constant velocity. The resulting filter amounts to a simple modification of existing integral algorithms. The new F-K and integral DMO algorithms resulting from these two approaches turn out to be equivalent, producing identical outputs when implemented in nonaliased fashion. As dip increases, their output become progressively larger than the outputs of either Hale's F-K method or the integral method generally associated with Deregowski and Rocca. This trend can be observed both on model data and field data. There are two additional results of this analysis, both following from the wave‐equation calibration on an arbitrary 3-D dipping reflector. The first is a proof that the entire imaging sequence (not just the DMO part) is true‐amplitude when the DMO is done correctly. The second result is a handy formula showing exactly how the zero‐phase wavelet on the final migrated image is a stretched version of the zero‐phase deconvolved source wavelet. This result quantitatively expresses the loss of vertical resolution due to dip and offset.",10.1190/1.1443351
The World‐Wide Gravity Program Of The Mapping And Charting Research Laboratory Of Ohio State University,"This paper deals with the geodetic applications of the gravity method. Gravity anomalies permit the absolute undulations of the geoid and the absolute deflections of the vertical to be determined. In turn, these, together with astronomical observations, form the basis for a World Geodetic System for the control of small scale maps beginning with the scale 1:100,000. They serve also, together with existing triangulations, for the correction of the dimensions of the reference ellipsoid. Additional gravity surveys are needed in order to obtain these and other minor objectives. Cooperation among scientists and agencies of different countries concerned with these problems is a prerequisite for the success of this world‐wide program.",10.1190/1.1437722
Determination Of Density For Reduction Of Gravimeter Observations*,"This paper outlines a method whereby the density factor used in the Bouguer correction for elevation of a gravity station may be determined. Frequently in the past it has been the practice to assign a density factor based on measurements made upon samples of surface materials in such manner as to give the density in situ, depending upon the judgment of the field man to select samples representative of the near-surface materials. At best, this is a cursory determination which only fortuitously might lead to the correct density for large topographic features. The method outlined here in effect weighs the topography by gravimeter observations taken along a profile crossing the feature. From these data the effective density of the material comprising the topographic feature is determined by a simple graphtcal method.",10.1190/1.0403176
A Case Study Of Stratigraphic Interpretation Using Shear And Compressional Seismic Data,"This paper describes the use of surface recorded compressional and horizontal shear wave seismic data to detect lateral changes in the physical properties of a clastic unit. Shear and compressional wave transit times were measured across a selected interval from CDP stacked sections derived from data collected along coincident shear and compressional seismic lines. At each surface position the ratio of the shear to compressional transit time across the target horizon is calculated. It is shown that lateral variations in this ratio, coupled with the behavior of the individual transit time curves, can be used to infer changes in the physical properties of a formation. The horizon selected for this case study was the lower Pennsylvanian Morrow formation which produces gas from channel sand bodies at the Empire Abo field, New Mexico. A detailed geologic section of the producing horizon was mapped along a seismic line oriented so that it crossed productive and nonproductive regions of the field. Shear and compressional Vibroseis® surveys were conducted along this surface profile using data acquisition parameters designed to produce comparable signal‐to‐noise ratios and resolution in both sets of field data. After processing, the shear and compressional interval transit times through the Morrow formation decreased in going from nonproductive to productive thicknesses of sand. Furthermore there is a proportionately greater decrease in the shear wave transit time than in the compressional transit time resulting in an overall decrease in the ratio of shear to compressional transit times. While several possible physical changes in the lateral properties of the reservoir could explain these observations, it is concluded that the primary mechanism causing these ratio changes is variation in the sand‐shale ratio within the Morrow formation.",10.1190/1.1441686
Geologic Implications Of Aeromagnetic Data For The Eastern Continental Margin Of The United States,"An aeromagnetic survey extending from the Gulf of Maine to the tip of Florida was conducted by the U. S. Naval Oceanographic Office between 1964 and 1966. Flight traverses were flown in a northwesterly direction at right angles to the geologic grain. The flight lines were approximately 800 km long and had an 8‐km separation. The survey traversed part of the New England, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain provinces and extended some 320 km beyond the continental shelf into the Atlantic Ocean. Despite the wide flight‐line spacing, numerous geological and structural features became apparent from this survey. Interpretation of these features was aided by using the available gravity and seismic data in addition to the State and Provincial geologic maps. The residual aeromagnetic map shows a continuous magnetic high on or near the continental slope as far south as the 31st parallel. At about the 36th parallel, this east‐coast magnetic anomaly splits into two branches, and both of them parallel the 850‐fathom contour. At the 31st parallel, the outer branch of the anomaly swings westward and crosses the coastline near Brunswick, Georgia. This continuous magnetic anomaly may result from an igneous intrusive body that parallels the edge of the pre‐Paleozoic continental landmass. These magnetic data suggest that Florida and part of Georgia were added to the paleo‐continent in pre‐Paleozoic time. Landward from the east‐coast anomaly, the magnetic field is quite variable, whereas oceanward it has an extremely small gradient. The absence of magnetic anomalies east of the continental slope suggests that in this region layer 2 may be composed of metamorphosed basalt. The characteristic magnetic patterns observed over the Piedmont and New England provinces extend oceanward to the east‐coast anomaly.",10.1190/1.1439970
A Side‐By‐Side Test Of Four Land Gravity Meters,"Four different land gravity meters were run side by side on a test range in eastern Texas. This test range was designed to duplicate typical field survey conditions encountered in gravity measurements on 3-D land seismic surveys. A profile of 270 stations was acquired with a station spacing of 33.5 m (110 ft). The four meters were Scintrex CG-3, Sodin, LaCoste  Romberg (LR) G-meter, and Edcon/LR Super-G meter. The purpose of this study was to determine which of the four meters had the best balance of accuracy, convenience, and speed of measurement for these specialized surveys. All four meters had their limitations, and no single meter was greatly superior to the others. The CG-3 was awkward in leveling, had a large (368 μGal per day) drift rate, and had some quirks in its user interface. The Sodin meter had problems controlling its temperature and, at one point, had a very high 935 μGal per day drift rate. It had the poorest accuracy of the four. The G-meter lacked a convenient digital user interface; thus, it was susceptible to operator blunder in misreading or recording the data. The Super-G meter also had some problems in its user interface, had only a 6-mGal range without a range change, and was the heaviest of the field instruments. An unbiased statistical estimator was developed to analyze the data. The technique determined the best three meters at each station. Both the G-meter and the Super-G meter produced the most accurate data. They had an average absolute deviation from the mean of 20 and 23 μGal, respectively. In comparison, the two quartz meters—the CG-3 and the Sodin—had an average absolute deviation from the mean of 31 and 46 μGal, respectively. We would like to see the manufacturers improve (or add, in the case of the G-meter and the Sodin) their digital interfaces. Additionally, we would like to see upgrades in the thermal control systems in all the meters. The single largest amount of station time was devoted to leveling (rather than reading) the meters. Significant advances can be envisioned to create fast, automated leveling systems in all the meters.",10.1190/1.1444586
Evaluation Of Terrain Effects In Aem Surveys Using The Boundary Element Method,"In mountainous areas, electromagnetic terrain effects are readily observed in the course of VLF (14–20 kHz) measurements made on the surface and constitute a serious source of geological noise that affects the collected data. One may, therefore, inquire whether similar effects will be observed during the course of conventional helicopter‐towed electromagnetic (HEM) surveys as the frequency of the newer systems is increased beyond the lower regions of the audio range. To answer the question, we have evaluated the terrain effects that would be observed with a conventional HEM system in a number of simple cases. The operating frequency chosen for most of the numerical simulations was 8 kHz, while the topographic features investigated were taken to be two‐dimensional. The calculations were done using the boundary element method of solving the appropriate integral equations. Accuracy of the numerical solutions was shown to vary from 1 percent for a half space to 10 percent for a shallow valley where the verification was done on a laboratory scale model. For the models investigated, the amplitude of the computed secondary fields shows a distinct correlation with the overflown topography. Surprisingly, however, the phase of the secondary field remains invariant and so may be reliably used to compute the resistivity of the terrain below the aircraft.",10.1190/1.1443240
Direct Fourier Migration For Vertical Velocity Variations,"The Stolt f‐x migration algorithm is a direct (i.e. nonrecursive) Fourier‐domain technique based on a change of variables, or equivalently a mapping, that converts the unmigrated spectrum to the migrated spectrum. The algorithm is simple and efficient but limited to constant velocity. A v(z) f‐k migration method, capable of very high accuracy for vertical velocity variations, can be formulated as a nonstationary filter that avoids the change of variables. The result is a direct Fourier‐domain process that, for each wavenumber, applies a nonstationary migration filter to a vector of input frequency samples to create a vector of output frequency samples. The filter matrix is analytically specified in the mixed domain of input frequency and migrated time. It can be moved to the full‐Fourier domain of input frequency and output frequency by a fast Fourier transform. When applied for constant velocity, the v(z) f‐k algorithm is slower than the Stolt method but without the usual artifacts related to complex‐valued frequency‐domain interpolation. Vertical velocity variations, through an rms‐velocity (straight‐ray) assumption, are handled by the v(z) f‐k method with no additional cost. Greater accuracy at slight additional expense is obtained by extending the method to a WKBJ phase‐shift integral. This has the same accuracy as recursive phase shift and is similar in cost. For constant velocity, the full‐Fourier domain migration filter is a discrete approximation to a Dirac delta function whose singularity tracks along a hyperbola determined by the migration velocity. For variable velocity, the migration filter has significant energy between hyperbolic trajectories determined by the minimum and maximum instantaneous velocities. The full‐Fourier domain offers interesting conceptual parallels to Stolt's algorithm. However, unless a more efficient method of calculating the Fourier filter matrix can be found, the mixed‐domain method will be faster. The mixed‐domain nonstationary filter moves the input data from the Fourier domain to the migrated time domain as it migrates. It is faster because the migration filter is known analytically in the mixed domain.",10.1190/1.1487096
Planning Of Urban Underground Infrastructure Using A Broadband Seismic Landstreamer — Tomography Results And Uncertainty Quantifications From A Case Study In Southwestern Sweden,"We have developed a multicomponent broadband seismic landstreamer system based on digital sensors and particularly suitable for noisy environments and areas in which high-resolution images of the subsurface are desired. We have evaluated results, interpretations, and approaches using the streamer in the planning of an approximately 3-km-long underground tunnel in the city of Varberg in the southwestern Sweden. Prospective targets were imaging of the shallow (20 m) bedrock surface and weak zones, such as fracture and shear zones. Over the course of three weeks, 25 profiles were acquired with a total length of approximately 7.5 km using a source and receiver spacing of 2–4 m. A novel approach of the data acquisition was to integrate the landstreamer with wireless sensors in areas in which the accessibility was restricted by roads and also to increase the source-receiver distances (offsets). Although the area was highly noisy, the seismic data, in conjunction with available boreholes, successfully led to delineation of the bedrock surface, its undulations, and areas of poor rock quality. To overcome challenges due to geologic complexities and crooked-line data acquisition, 3D tomographic inversion of first breaks was carried out. Comparisons of the results with the existing boreholes indicated that in most places, the bedrock surface was well resolved by the method, which supported the indication of weak zones in the bedrock, represented by low-velocity structures in the tomographic results. We also evaluated the effect of poor geodetic surveying, particularly regarding elevation data, which adulterated the tomography results toward undulating bedrock surfaces or zones of low velocities.",10.1190/geo2015-0052.1
True And Apparent Spectra Of Buried Polarizable Targets,"If the chargeability of a buried target is not infinitesimal, the popularly used low chargeability approximation formulated by Seigel (1959) can produce large errors in the computation of apparent polarizability spectra. A more accurate alternative approximation, based on a complex, frequency dependent ""dilution factor"" is presented. It turns out that for dispersions of the minimum phase shift type this approximation can be somewhat simplified and that for targets with such a dispersion, buried in a nondispersive host rock, the apparent log‐phase spectrum is only slightly different from a vertically shifted version of the true phase spectrum of the target. These results should be useful for the computation of apparent polarizabilities in numerical modeling for IP, and in attempts for mineral discrimination through field measurements of phase spectra.",10.1190/1.1441648
Random Noise Attenuation Using Local Signal-And-Noise Orthogonalization,"We have developed a novel approach to attenuate random noise based on local signal-and-noise orthogonalization. In this approach, we first removed from a seismic section using one of the conventional denoising operators and then applied a weighting operator to the initially denoised section to predict the signal-leakage energy, as well as retrieve it from the initial noise section. The weighting operator was obtained by solving a least-squares minimization problem via shaping regularization with a smoothness constraint. Next, the initially denoised section and the retrieved signal were combined to form the final denoised section. The proposed denoising approach corresponded to orthogonalizing the initially denoised signal and noise in a local manner. We evaluated the denoising performance using local similarity. To test the orthogonalization property of the estimated signal and noise, we calculated the local similarity map between the denoised signal section and removed noise section. Low values of local similarity indicated a good orthogonalization and thus a good denoising performance. Synthetic and field data examples revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in applications to noise attenuation for conventional and simultaneous-source seismic data.",10.1190/geo2014-0227.1
Frequency‐Dependent Shear‐Wave Splitting In Thinly Layered Media With Intrinsic Anisotropy,"In multilayered media one normally observes two distinct shear‐wave phases that are polarized perpendicularly to each other and propagate at different velocities. One of them, the SH-wave, is a pure shear wave with particle motion parallel to layer interfaces and strictly perpendicular to the incidence plane and the propagation direction. The other one, the qSV-wave, is a so‐called quasi‐shear wave whose particle motion also contains a longitudinal portion. The velocities and attenuations of both phases depend on the frequency and the angle of incidence. However, this dependence is different for SH-waves and qSV-waves.",10.1190/1.1444567
Rational Interpolation Of Qp-Traveltimes For Semblance-Based Anisotropy Estimation In Layered Vti Media,"The   τ-p   domain is the natural domain for anisotropy parameter estimation in horizontally layered media. The need to transform the data to the   τ-p   domain or to pick traveltimes in the   t-x   domain is, however, a practical disadvantage. To overcome this, we combine   τ-p  -derived traveltimes and offsets in horizontally layered transversely isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI) with a rational interpolation procedure applied in the   t-x   domain. This combination results in an accurate and efficient   t-x  -based semblance analysis for anisotropy parameter estimation from the moveout of qP-waves in horizontally layered VTI media. The semblance analysis is applied to the moveout to search directly for the interval values of the relevant parameters. To achieve this, the method is applied in a layer-stripping fashion. We demonstrate the method using synthetic data examples and show that it is robust in the presence of random noise and moderate statics.",10.1190/1.2938036
Weak-Anisotropy Moveout Approximations For P-Waves In Homogeneous Layers Of Monoclinic Or Higher Anisotropy Symmetries,"We have used so-called weak anisotropy (WA) parameterization as an alternative to the parameterization of generally anisotropic media by a stiffness tensor. WA parameters consist of linear combinations of normalized stiffness-tensor elements controlling various seismic signatures; hence, they are theoretically extractable from seismic data. They are dimensionless and can be designed to have the same order of magnitude. WA parameters, similarly to Thomsen-type parameters, have a clear physical interpretation. They are, however, applicable to anisotropy of any symmetry, strength, and orientation. They are defined in coordinate systems independent of the symmetry elements of the studied media. Expressions using WA parameters naturally simplify as the anisotropy becomes weaker or as the anisotropy symmetry increases. We expect that, due to these useful properties, WA parameterization can potentially provide a framework for seismic data processing in generally anisotropic media. Using the WA parameterization, we have derived and tested approximate P-wave moveout formulas for a homogeneous layer of up-to-monoclinic symmetry, underlain by a horizontal reflector coinciding with a symmetry plane. The derived traveltime formulas represent an expansion of the traveltime with respect to (small) WA parameters. For the comparison with standard moveout formulas, we expressed ours in the common form of nonhyperbolic moveout, containing normal moveout velocity and a quartic coefficient as functions of the WA parameters. The accuracy of our formulas depends strongly on the deviation of ray- and phase-velocity directions (controlled by the deviation of the ray and phase velocities). The errors do not generally increase with increasing offset, nor do they increase with decreasing anisotropy symmetry. The accuracy of our formulas is comparable with, or better than, the accuracy of commonly used formulas.",10.1190/geo2015-0223.1
3-D Ground‐Penetrating Radar Simulation And Plane‐Wave Theory In Anisotropic Media,"Modeling ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) waves requires simulation of the 3-D full wavefield and the correct description of the electromagnetic (EM) properties. Magnetic and dielectric relaxations are described by relaxation functions associated with each principal component of the respective tensorial property. Anisotropy is modeled up to orthorhombic symmetry, i.e., the principal coordinate systems of the three EM material tensors coincide, and each property is described by three different principal components. The algorithm uses the pseudospectral method for computing the spatial derivatives and a second‐order finite difference in time. A complete plane‐wave analysis, including energy balance, gives the expressions of measurable quantities such as the EM-wave velocity and the quality factor as a function of frequency and propagation direction. The algorithm reproduces the wavefront shape and attenuation predicted by the plane‐wave analysis. In addition, the results are in excellent agreement with an analytical 3-D transient solution. The modeling is applied to evaluation of the EM response of two pipes buried in an anisotropic sand overlying a clay layer. The results demonstrate that anisotropy and loss mechanisms cause significant amplitude and phase distortions.",10.1190/1.1444841
Low‐Frequency Electrical Properties,"In the interpretation of induced polarization data, it is commonly assumed that metallic mineral polarization dominantly or solely causes the observed response. However, at low frequencies, there is a variety of active chemical processes which involve the movement or transfer of electrical charge. Measurements of electrical properties at low frequencies (such as induced polarization) observe such movement of charge and thus monitor many geochemical processes at a distance. Examples in which this has been done include oxidation‐reduction of metallic minerals such as sulfides, cation exchange on clays, and a variety of clay‐organic reactions relevant to problems in toxic waste disposal and petroleum exploration. By using both the frequency dependence and nonlinear character of the complex resistivity spectrum, these reactions may be distinguished from each other and from barren or reactionless materials.",10.1190/1.1441880
Deep Electrical Prospecting—A Reply,"Mr. Yüngül's review of the ""Resistolog"" procedure has been read with interest. The primary reason for publishing Resistolog data was the hope that a mathematical explanation for the observed phenomena would result. Mr. Yüngül's paper is most welcome inasmuch as it represents an effort in the desired direction.",10.1190/1.1437383
Two‐Dimensional Model Seismology,"The solutions of many problems in seismology may be obtained by means of ultrasonic pulses propagating in small scale models. Thin sheets, serving as two dimensional models, are particularly advantageous because of their low cost, availability, ease of fabrication into various configurations, lower energy requirements, and appropriate dilatational‐to‐shear‐velocity ratios. Four examples are presented: flexural waves in a sheet, Rayleigh waves in a low velocity layer overlying a semi‐infinite high velocity layer, Rayleigh waves in a high velocity layer overlying a semi‐infinite low velocity layer, and body and surface waves in a disk.",10.1190/1.1437982
A Semianalytic Solution To The Response Of A Triaxial Induction Logging Tool In A Layered Biaxial Anisotropic Formation,"We have developed a forward-modeling method to compute the response of a triaxial induction logging tool in a layered biaxial anisotropic dipping formation without borehole and invasion zones. The purpose of this development is to provide a fast-forward computation algorithm to handle cracks in transverse isotropic (TI) formations in oil exploration, which is a mathematically challenging problem for log data inversion. We solve for the spectral-domain transverse electromagnetic (EM) field equations, propagation matrix, and reflection matrix in a biaxial anisotropic planarly layered media. The EM fields in the space domain are obtained by a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We derive formulations of the EM fields generated by three orthogonal transmitting coils in a fully anisotropic layered media. The proposed formulations are based on arbitrary relative dipping and azimuthal and tool angles; thus, we obtain the full coupling matrix connecting source excitations and magnetic fields anywhere along the tool axis. Computation results using this method in the response of triaxial induction tools in several cases were compared with published data in TI formations and biaxial layered formations. Our results agreed very well with the published data.",10.1190/geo2015-0105.1
"A Propagating Algorithm For Determining Nth-Order Polynomial, Least‐Squares Fits","An algorithm is described which iteratively solves for the coefficients of successively higher‐order, least‐squares polynomial fits in terms of the results for the previous, lower‐order polynomial fit. The technique takes advantage of the special properties of the least‐squares or Hankel matrix, for which Ai,j=Ai+1,j-1. Only the first and last column vectors of the inverse matrix are needed at each stage to continue the iteration to the next higher stage. An analogous procedure may be used to determine the inverse of such least‐squares type matrices. The inverse of each square submatrix is determined from the inverse of the previous, lower‐order submatrix. The results using this algorithm are compared with the method of fitting orthogonal polynomials to data points. While the latter method gives higher accuracy when high‐order polynomials are fitted to the data, it requires many more computations. The increased accuracy of the orthogonal‐polynomial fit is valuable when high precision of fitting is required; however, for experimental data with inherent inaccuracies, the added computations outweigh the possible benefit derived from the more accurate fitting. A Fortran listing of the algorithm is given.",10.1190/1.1440793
Resistive Limit Modeling Of Airborne Electromagnetic Data,"When a confined conductive target embedded in a conductive host is energized by an electromagnetic (EM) source, current flow in the target comes from both direct induction of vortex currents and current channeling. At the resistive limit, a modified magnetometric resistivity integral equation method can be used to rapidly model the current channeling component of the response of a thin-plate target energized by an airborne EM transmitter. For towed-bird transmitter–receiver geometries, the airborne EM anomalies of near-surface, weakly conductive features of large strike extent may be almost entirely attributable to current channeling. However, many targets in contact with a conductive host respond both inductively and galvanically to an airborne EM system. In such cases, the total resistive-limit response of the target is complicated and is not the superposition of the purely inductive and purely galvanic resistive-limit profiles. Numerical model experiments demonstrate that while current channeling increases the width of the resistive-limit airborne EM anomaly of a wide horizontal plate target, it does not necessarily increase the peak anomaly amplitude.",10.1190/1.1468609
Where Is The Zero‐Velocity Layer?,"The zero‐velocity layer was introduced in Higginbotham et al. (1985) to increase the maximum dip imaging capability of finite‐difference depth migration. Beasley and Lynn (1992) adapted the idea to improve the imaging, again using finite‐difference depth migration, of seismic data acquired in areas of irregular topography. Beasley and Lynn's application improves upon the conventional method of processing, which is to time shift the data from the acquisition surface to a horizontal datum, and then migrate using the near‐surface velocity above the surface and the best estimate of seismic velocity below the surface. The conventional procedure typically produces artifacts in the shallow part of the section that are characteristic of overmigration. To reduce these artifacts, velocities are often reduced for the migration step. The use of the zero‐velocity layer overcomes the need to adjust the migration velocities. Here, a component of the migration velocity is set to zero in the layer between the datum and the surface. The function of the zero‐velocity layer in migration is to remove the elevation‐static correction applied in shifting the data to the flat datum. Only after the data have migrated through the zero‐velocity layer to the irregular recording surface does the migration begin to act in its customary sense, moving energy from trace to trace.",10.1190/1.1444126
Transient Electromagnetic Sounding For Groundwater,"The feasibility of using the transient electromagnetic sounding (TS or TDEM) method for groundwater exploration can be studied by means of numerical models. As examples of its applicability to groundwater exploration, we study four groundwater exploration problems: (1) mapping of alluvial fill and gravel zones over bedrock; (2) mapping of sand and gravel lenses in till; (3) detection of salt or brackish water interfaces in freshwater aquifers; and (4) determination of hydrostratigraphy. These groundwater problems require determination of the depth to bedrock; location of resistive, high‐porosity zones associated with fresh water; determination of formation resistivity to assess water quality; and determination of lithology and geometry, respectively. The TS method is best suited for locating conductive targets, and has very good vertical resolution. Unlike other sounding techniques where the receiver‐transmitter array must be expanded to sound more deeply, the depth of investigation for the TS method is a function of the length of time the transient is recorded. Present equipment limitations require that exploration targets with resistivities of 50 Ω ⋅ m or more be at least 50 m deep to determine their resistivity. The maximum depth of exploration is controlled by the geoelectrical section and background electromagnetic (EM) noise. For a particular exploration problem, numerical studies are recommended to determine if the target is detectable.",10.1190/1.1442158
True Amplitude Corrections For A Narrow-Angle One-Way Elastic Wave Equation,"Wavefield extrapolators using one-way wave equations are computationally efficient methods for accurate traveltime modeling in laterally heterogeneous media, and have been used extensively in many seismic forward modeling and migration problems. However, most leading-order, one-way wave equations do not simulate waveform amplitudes accurately and this is primarily because energy flux is not accounted for correctly. I review the derivation of a leading-order, narrow-angle, one-way elastic wave equation for 3D media. I derive correction terms that enable energy-flux normalization and introduce a new higher-order, narrow-angle, one-way elastic wave extrapolator. By implementing these correction terms, the new true amplitude wave extrapolator allows accurate amplitude estimates in the presence of strong gradients. I present numerical examples for 1D velocity transition models to show that (1) the leading-order, narrow-angle propagator accurately models traveltimes, but overestimates transmitted- or primary-wave amplitudes and (2) the new amplitude corrected narrow-angle propagator accurately models both the traveltimes and amplitudes of all forward-traveling waves.",10.1190/1.2430694
The Signature Of An Air Gun Array: Computation From Near‐Field Measurements Including Interactions,"We designed a system to enable the signature of an air gun array to be calculated at any point in the water from a number of simultaneous independent measurements of the near‐field pressure field [subject of a patent application]. The number of these measurements must not be less than the number of guns in the array. The underlying assumption in our method is that the oscillating bubble produced by an air gun is small compared with the wavelengths of seismic interest. Each bubble thus behaves as a point source, both in the generation of seismic waves and in its response to incident seismic radiation produced by other nearby bubbles. It follows that the interaction effects between the bubbles may be described in terms of spherical waves. The array of interacting guns is equivalent to a notional array of noninteracting guns whose combined seismic radiation is identical. The seismic signatures of the equivalent independent elements of this notional array can be determined from the near‐field measurements. The seismic radiation pattern emitted by the whole array can be computed from these signatures by linear superposition, with a spherical correction applied. The method is tested by comparing far‐field signatures computed in this way with field measurements made in deep water. The computed and measured signatures match each other very closely. By comparison, signatures computed neglecting this interaction are a poor match to the measurements.",10.1190/1.1441289
Memory-Efficient Displacement-Based Internal Friction For Wave Propagation Simulation,"The characterization of anelastic losses due to material internal friction has become increasingly important in geophysical exploration and other seismological applications, as these losses greatly affect the amplitude and dispersion of seismic waves. Anelasticity is usually specified in terms of the material's quality factor, Q. Different viscoelastic models have been used to represent Q as a function of frequency. Most of these models are defined in terms of stresses and strains as the primary variables. Thus, in three dimensions, a separate model needs to be associated with each of the six strain components. We introduce an internal friction model that uses, instead, displacements as primary variables. For a fiber, the proposed model consists of a set of three distinct elements in parallel with different relaxation mechanisms: namely, two elements that consist of a spring and a dashpot in series (Maxwell) and a third element that consists of a spring and a dashpot in parallel (Voigt). In addition to saving memory, this formulation is particularly suitable for finite-element schemes. The model exhibits an almost constant quality factor within the frequency range of interest, with a tolerance of 5% with respect to the target Q value, and provides a close approximation to the variation of the phase-velocity with frequency—as has been observed in empirical data. The extension of this model to 3D anelastic problems and its use in idealized cases, such as an infinite-space, a half-space, and a layered half-space, and the comparison of results with semi-analytical reference solutions obtained from theory and previous, similar studies, corroborates the validity of the proposed model for incorporating anelastic losses in wave propagation problems.",10.1190/geo2011-0019.1
"A Temporal Trend In Compliance Measurements Near A Gas Hydrate Accumulation, Northern Cascadia","Ocean surface gravity waves produce temporally correlated pressure and vertical displacements on the ocean floor. Compliance is the ratio between the pressure and the resulting displacement. Pressures are measured by a differential pressure gauge, whereas a broadband seismometer measures velocities that are directly related to the displacements in the frequency domain. These instruments are installed on the Cascadia accretionary prism as part of NEPTUNE Canada's ocean-floor network. Gas hydrates have the property of stiffening marine sediment, i.e., reducing the compliance. A compliance measurement is dependent on the elastic parameters of the sediment, particularly, the shear modulus. We have computed compliance from raw data, daily, for 203 days and determined the temporal variation in shear modulus of a region approximately 390 m northeast of the undersea area known as Bullseye Vent. Our aim was to investigate the evolution of the elastic properties of the subsurface in this region. The compliance was determined over a bandwidth of 0.01–0.03 Hz, and had peak sensitivity to the sediment elastic structure at approximately 275 m below seafloor, for a water depth of 1250 m — determined by the gravity wave dispersion relation. Bullseye Vent is not a steady-state system! We observed a linear decrease in compliance of approximately 1% between October 2010 and May 2011, corresponding with an average change of 1% in the shear modulus over the depth of investigation. This corresponds to up to a 13% change solely in gas hydrate content in the first 100 m; a change that resulted from a simplified 1D four-layer model, which does not reflect the complexity and three-dimensionality of the hydrate system. A 13% change in hydrate content was likely an overestimate because the compliance function at 1250 m had limited sensitivity to the uppermost sediments.",10.1190/geo2014-0531.1
Separation And Imaging Of Seismic Diffractions Using Migrated Dip-Angle Gathers,Common-reflection angle migration can produce migrated gathers either in the scattering-angle domain or in the dip-angle domain. The latter reveals a clear distinction between reflection and diffraction events. We derived analytical expressions for events in the dip-angle domain and found that the shape difference can be used for reflection/diffraction separation. We defined reflection and diffraction models in the Radon space. The Radon transform allowed us to isolate diffractions from reflections and noise. The separation procedure can be performed after either time migration or depth migration. Synthetic and real data examples confirmed the validity of this technique.,10.1190/geo2012-0017.1
Recent Advances In Uranium Exploration With Electronic Alpha Cups,"We compare data from a new radon measuring device, based on electronic alpha cups with data from the nonelectronic, plastic alpha cups commonly used in exploring for uranium. A burial time of three days appears to be adequate for the electronic alpha cups to collect exploration data equivalent to those from plastic sensing devices. The advantages of the electronic cups are short time of burial and instant read‐out in the field; the major disadvantage is the capital expenditure required for the instruments. It is possible the cups may be useful for copper exploration also.",10.1190/1.1440776
Correction For The Influence Of Velocity Lenses On Nonhyperbolic Moveout Inversion For Vti Media,"Nonhyperbolic moveout analysis plays an increasingly important role in velocity model building because it provides valuable information for anisotropic parameter estimation. However, lateral heterogeneity associated with stratigraphic lenses such as channels and reefs can significantly distort the moveout parameters, even when the structure is relatively simple. We analyze the influence of a low-velocity isotropic lens on nonhyperbolic moveout inversion for horizontally layered VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) models. Synthetic tests demonstrate that a lens can cause substantial, laterally varying errors in the normal-moveout velocity    ( Vnmo )    and the anellipticity parameter   η  . The area influenced by the lens can be identified using the residual moveout after the nonhyperbolic moveout correction as well as the dependence of errors in    Vnmo    and   η   on spreadlength. To remove such errors in    Vnmo    and   η  , we propose a correction algorithm designed for a lens embedded in a horizontally layered overburden. This algorithm involves estimation of the incidence angle of the ray passing through the lens for each recorded trace. With the assumption that lens-related perturbation of the raypath is negligible, the lens-induced traveltime shifts are computed from the corresponding zero-offset time distortion (i.e., from ""pull-up"" or ""push-down"" anomalies). Synthetic tests demonstrate that this algorithm substantially reduces the errors in the effective and interval parameters    Vnmo    and   η  . The corrected traces and reconstructed ""background"" values of    Vnmo    and   η   are suitable for anisotropic time imaging and producing a high-quality stack.",10.1190/1.3569799
Limitations On Impedance Inversion Of Band‐Limited Reflection Data,"A seismic approximate impedance log is often the ultimate output in the sequence of seismic data‐processing steps. In principle, the true acoustic impedance is obtainable from the inversion of full‐band impulse response. Because the seismic data necessarily is band limited, its inversion obviously would produce an approximate impedance log. A question addressed is how the true and reconstructed logs are related and a mathematical relationship between the two is derived without the assumptions required in an existing derivation of the same result. The deductions also include the contribution of an individual seismic frequency in the reconstruction of the impedance and, in particular, a simple formula for the contribution of direct‐current (dc) frequency, which never is recorded but is required to supplement the inversion. Analytical expressions are derived for the reconstructed impedance corresponding to any given frequency band for two cases: a simple discontinuity and a bed sandwiched between two similar half‐spaces. While analyzing the results, some conclusions pertinent to seismic exploration are drawn. A criterion is formulated to decide what should be termed a thin bed within a homogeneous half‐space in the context of a white band of frequencies, in contrast to a single dominant frequency, which is the basis of the Widess criterion.",10.1190/1.1444791
Ultrasonic Shear‐Wave Velocities In Rocks Subjected To Simulated Overburden Pressure And Internal Pore Pressure,"Change in shear‐wave velocity for four dry sedimentary rocks has been studied as a function of the variation of both external hydrostatic pressure and internal pore pressure in the range 0 to 2,500 psi. The experimental method employs a beam of ultrasonic energy passing through a liquid in which a copper‐jacketed parallel‐sided slab of rock is rotated. The shear‐wave velocity is calculated from the laws of refraction and reflection of waves at a liquid‐solid boundary applied to the angle at which minimum energy is transmitted. The variation of shear‐wave velocity with pressure has been found to be a function of net overburden pressure, Pe-nPi, where Pe=external hydrostatic pressure on the jacketed sample, Pi=internal pore pressure and n = a pressure‐dependent factor less than unity. The values of n at several differential pressures were chosen to yield a smooth curve passing through the displaced data points when the shear‐wave velocities were plotted as a function of net overburden pressure. Using the n values so obtained, the matrix compressibility Cr for two of the sandstones has been calculated from the relation n=[CB-Cr]/CB. The bulk compressibility CB for these two rocks had previously been obtained experimentally as a function of differential pressure. The values obtained for the matrix compressibility are in the range expected from a knowledge of the grain and cementing materials for these sandstones.",10.1190/1.1439526
Monte Carlo Data-Driven Tight Frame For Seismic Data Recovery,"Seismic data denoising and interpolation are essential preprocessing steps in any seismic data processing chain. Sparse transforms with a fixed basis are often used in these two steps. Recently, we have developed an adaptive learning method, the data-driven tight frame (DDTF) method, for seismic data denoising and interpolation. With its adaptability to seismic data, the DDTF method achieves high-quality recovery. For 2D seismic data, the DDTF method is much more efficient than traditional dictionary learning methods. But for 3D or 5D seismic data, the DDTF method results in a high computational expense. The motivation behind this work is to accelerate the filter bank training process in DDTF, while doing less damage to the recovery quality. The most frequently used method involves only a randomly selective subset of the training set. However, this random selection method uses no prior information of the data. We have designed a new patch selection method for DDTF seismic data recovery. We suppose that patches with higher variance contain more information related to complex structures, and should be selected into the training set with higher probability. First, we calculate the variance of all available patches. Then for each patch, a uniformly distributed random number is generated and the patch is preserved if its variance is greater than the random number. Finally, all selected patches are used for filter bank training. We call this procedure the Monte Carlo DDTF method. We have tested the trained filter bank on seismic data denoising and interpolation. Numerical results using this Monte Carlo DDTF method surpass random or regular patch selection DDTF when the sizes of the training sets are the same. We have also used state-of-the-art methods based on the curvelet transform, block matching 4D, and multichannel singular spectrum analysis as comparisons when dealing with field data.",10.1190/geo2015-0343.1
Fast Location Of Seismicity: A Migration-Type Approach With Application To Hydraulic-Fracturing Data,"We propose a new approach for the location of seismic sources using a technique inspired by Gaussian-beam migration of three-component data. This approach requires only the preliminary picking of time intervals around a detected event and is much less sensitive to the picking precision than standard location procedures. Furthermore, this approach is characterized by a high degree of automation. The polarization information of three-component data is estimated and used to perform initial-value ray tracing. By weighting the energy of the signal using Gaussian beams around these rays, the stacking is restricted to physically relevant regions only. Event locations correspond to regions of maximum energy in the resulting image. We have successfully applied the method to synthetic data examples with 20%–30% white noise and to real data of a hydraulic-fracturing experiment, where events with comparatively small magnitudes   (0)   were recorded.",10.1190/1.2401139
Aeromagnetic Anomalies And Perspective Oil Traps In China,"Based on analyses of aeromagnetic data from known oil and gas fields in China, aeromagnetic anomalies have been classified according to their genesis into three types: (1) structure‐associated anomalies related to volcanic rock, (2) anomalies related to magnetic basement fault blocks, and (3) structure‐associated anomalies related to weakly magnetic sedimentary strata. The most successful applications of aeromagnetic data for locating favorable oil and gas structures are in the following kinds of areas: (1) areas where basement fault blocks of inhomogeneous lithology and magnetization are developed; (2) areas of weakly magnetic layered strata with a considerable thickness, either effusive or clastic deposits; and (3) areas where magnetic layers have undergone tectonic deformation with faulting and dip angles larger than 30 degrees. For reliable detection of such structures in sedimentary rocks and associated oil and gas traps, an integrated interpretation of geological and geophysical data is necessary.",10.1190/1.1443539
Reverse Time Migration In Tilted Transversely Isotropic (Tti) Media,"Reverse time migration (RTM) exhibits great advantages over other imaging methods because it is based on computing numerical solutions to a two-way wave equation. It does not suffer from dip limitation like one-way downward continuation techniques do, thus enabling overturned reflections to be imaged. As well as correctly handling multipathing, RTM has the potential to image internal multiples when the boundaries responsible for generating the multiples are present in the model. In isotropic media, one can use a scalar acoustic wave equation for RTM of pressure data. In anisotropic media, P- and SV-waves are coupled together so, formally, elastic wave equations must be used for RTM. A new wave equation for P-waves is proposed in tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media that can be solved as part of an acoustic anisotropic RTM algorithm, using standard explicit finite differencing. If the shear velocity along the axis of symmetry is set to zero, stable numerical solutions can be computed for media with a vertical axis of symmetry and  ε  not less than  δ . In TTI media with rapid variations in the direction of the axis of symmetry, setting the shear velocity along the axis of symmetry to zero can cause numerical solutions to become unstable. A solution to this problem is proposed that involves using a small amount of nonzero shear velocity. The amount of shear velocity added is chosen to remove triplications from the SV wavefront and to minimize the anisotropic term of the SV reflection coefficient. We show modeling and high-quality RTM results in complex TTI media using this equation.",10.1190/1.3269902
Computing Gaussian Derivative Waveforms Of Any Order,"The first and second derivatives of a Gaussian, also known as Ricker wavelets, are often used as source waveforms in forward modeling of seismic and electromagnetic wavefields. In applications such as borehole acoustics, the source waveform has more cycles than traditional Ricker wavelets. For such sources, the higher-order derivatives of a Gaussian are a more accurate representation. Such a source waveform can be computed as the product of a Hermite polynomial and the Gaussian; taking the required derivative is not necessary. Explicit expressions for these polynomials are not required because they satisfy a recurrence relation and thus can be computed from the two lowest-order polynomials. The Gaussian is formulated in terms of the dominant frequency of the derivative order of the desired source waveform. Strictly causal waveforms are not possible with a Gaussian because of its infinite length. However, the computed waveform can be made (pseudo-) causal by shifting it along the positive time axis until its amplitude at time zero is less than a user-defined threshold. Numerical tests reveal that amplitudes at zero time are on the order of  10−6  if this shift is equal to the dominant frequency times the square root of the derivative order.",10.1190/1.2716624
Two And One‐Half Dimensional Born Inversion With An Arbitrary Reference,"Multidimensional inversion algorithms are presented for both prestack and poststack data gathered on a single line. These algorithms both image the subsurface (i.e., give a migrated section) and, given relative true amplitude data, estimate reflection strength or impedance on each reflector. The algorithms are ""two and one‐half dimensional"" (2.5-D) in that they incorporate three‐dimensional (3-D) wave propagation in a medium which varies in only two dimensions. The use of 3-D sources does not entail any computational penalty, and it avoids the serious degradation of amplitude incurred by using the 2-D wave equation. Our methods are based on the linearized inversion theory associated with the ""Born inversion."" Thus, we assume that the sound speed profile is well approximated by a given background velocity, plus a perturbation. It is this perturbation that we seek to reconstruct. We are able to treat the case of an arbitrary continuous background profile. However, the cost of implementation increases as one seeks to honor, successively, constant background, depth‐only dependent background, and, ultimately, fully lateral and depth‐dependent background. For depth‐only dependent background, the increase in CPU time is quite modest when compared to the constant‐background case. We exploit the high‐frequency character of seismic data ab initio. Therefore, we use ray theory and WKBJ Green's functions in deriving our inversion representations. Furthermore, our algorithms reduce to finding quantities by ray tracing with respect to a background medium. In the constant‐background case, the ray tracing can be eliminated and an explicit algorithm obtained. In the case of a depth‐only dependent background, the ray tracing can be done quite efficiently. Finally, in the general 2.5-D case, the ray‐tracing procedure becomes the principal issue. However, the robustness of the inversion allows for a sparse computation of rays and interpolation for intermediary values. The inversion techniques presented here cover the cases of common‐source gather, common‐receiver gather, and common‐offset gather. Zero offset is a special case of the last of these. For offset data, the reflection coefficient is angle‐dependent, so parameter extraction is more difficult than in the zero‐offset case. Nonetheless, we are able to determine the unknown angle pointwise and derive parameter estimates at the same time as we produce the image. For each reflector, this estimate of the output is based on the Kirchhoff approximation of the upward‐scattered data. Thus, it is constrained to neither small discontinuities in sound speed at the reflector nor to small offset angle as would be the case for a strict ""Born approximation"" of the reflection process. The prestack algorithms presented here are inversions of single gathers. The question of how best to composite or ""stack"" these inversions is analogous to the question for any migration scheme and is not treated here.",10.1190/1.1442238
High‐Resolution Crosswell Imaging Of A West Texas Carbonate Reservoir: Part 4—Reflection Imaging,"Reliable crosswell reflection imaging is a challenging task, even after the data have been wavefield‐separated in the time domain. Residual, strong coherent noise is still present in the data. Stacking is complicated by the wide range of reflection incidence angles available for imaging. With wavelengths of a few feet, small misalignments as a result of velocity or geometric errors produce destructive interference and degrade the quality of the stacked image. We present an imaging sequence that addressed these complications and allowed us to produce high‐quality stacked images for both P‐ and S‐waves from a large‐volume crosswell data set. A very good tie was achieved at both wells. Heterogeneities imaged from well to well included very thin beds [less than 5 ft (1.5 m) thick] within the reservoir, pinchouts, and a major angular unconformity—the Grayburg/San Andres—that could not be observed reliably with any other technique (log correlation, surface seismic imaging, or tomography). In fact, the produced crosswell reflection images exhibit dramatically higher resolution and continuity than the P‐wave traveltime tomogram.",10.1190/1.1443809
"Simple Time‐Variant, Band‐Pass Filtering By Operator Scaling","A convolutional method of time‐variant, band‐pass filtering presented shows that a change of filter cutoff frequencies with time is achieved by frequency scaling the amplitude spectrum of a reference operator. According to the scaling property of the Fourier transform, this frequency scaling is actually accomplished by a simple time‐domain scaling of the reference operator in which the filter operator at a sample point on a seismogram is obtained by compressing the reference operator after multiplication by a constant value. Therefore, the length of filter operator changes as the cutoff frequencies and the pass band change with time; the higher the cutoff frequencies and the broader the passband, the shorter the operator length. The algorithm does not involve any complex‐valued arithmetic that may significantly reduce the computational efficiency if a small computer is used. Because the time‐variant convolution formula is exact, the change of cutoff frequencies is not limited to slowly varying or monotonic variations used in other algorithms. The way of changing cutoff frequencies restricts the passband of the filter to a constant value in terms of octaves. However, this restriction can be relaxed significantly in practical usage by a cascaded implementation if the Nyquist frequency is well above the passband of the filter. Computational efficiency of the method is quite comparable to that of the time‐invariant, band‐pass filtering. Tests of the method on both real and synthetic data sets confirm the effectiveness of the filter.",10.1190/1.1443885
Coupling Of Explosive Energy In Three‐Dimensional Models,"The coupling of explosive generated P waves to the surrounding medium was investigated in a three‐dimensional laboratory model. For tightly coupled charges the amplitude was found to increase as W0.72, and the pulse width as W0.6, where W is the charge mass. Only a few hundredths of one percent of the energy in the explosion was transmitted in the initial P wave. When charges were fired in air‐filled cavities, the amplitude of the energy in the P wave increased to a maximum and then decreased with increasing cavity radius. The amplitudes from cavity shots were never less than the amplitudes for the tightly coupled shots. As the cavity radius increased, the pulse width of the P wave decreased to a minimum, an indication of a decrease in the size of the equivalent cavity, and then increased with further increase in cavity size. The period minimum is interpreted as corresponding to the transition from nonelastic to elastic response of the cavity wall. The cavity pressure at this transition is about one‐half the nominal tensile strength of the material. Scaling to the Sterling nuclear event is examined, and the conclusion is that the disagreement between field tests of decoupling and our experiments is due to the dominance of short period energy in our experiments. The results cast doubt on the general validity of partial decoupling.",10.1190/1.1440086
Avo Inversion Of Bsrs In Marine Gas Hydrate Studies,"We examine the usefulness of amplitude versus offset (AVO) analysis of bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs) for estimating associated marine gas hydrate and free-gas concentrations. A nonlinear Bayesian inversion is applied to estimate marginal probability distributions (MPDs) of physical parameters at a BSR interface, which are related to overlying gas hydrate and underlying free-gas concentrations via rock physics modeling. The problem is constrained further by prior information and re-parameterization of inversion results. Inversion of BSR AVO data from offshore Vancouver Island, Canada, shows that gas hydrate and free-gas concentrations are, respectively, 0%–23% and0%–2% of the pore volume, at a 90% credibility level. This result indicates that the data do not provide sufficient information to independently resolve gas hydrate and free-gas concentrations to useful accuracy. The study is directed primarily at AVO for gas-hydrate-related BSRs, but may have important applicability in testing the degree of constraint of formation characteristics in other AVO studies. The inversion method is applied also to syn-thetic AVO data generated from Ostrander's gas-sand model. In this case, MPDs sufficiently constrain the relationship between P- and S-wave velocities in the sandstone unit to determine if it is gas-charged. The variable degree of model constraint obtained in this AVO study highlights the need to include rigorous quantita-tive uncertainty analysis in all AVO studies.",10.1190/1.2435604
The Relationship Between Born Inversion And Migration For Common‐Midpoint Stacked Data,"The relationship between Born inversion and wave‐equation migration of common‐midpoint (CMP) stacked seismic reflection data is analytically determined. The three‐dimensional (3-D) velocity distribution obtained by Born inversion is shown to be directly related to the 3-D reflectivity function obtained by wave‐equation migration for full bandwidth or band‐limited data. The relationship is obtained by the reformulations of migration and Born inversion methods as inverse source problems for the 3-D wave equation. The reformulation leads to a definition of the reflectivity function as the source function for the wave equation. It also leads to determination of the Born inversion results by applying the algorithm for wave‐equation migration to modified surface data. The modified data are simply related to the CMP stacked data. Alternatively, Born inversion results may be obtained directly from the migrated section. Results from synthetic and recorded data are presented and found to be consistent with the theoretical developments.",10.1190/1.1441628
Refined Finite‐Difference Simulations Using Local Integral Forms: Application To Telluric Fields In Two Dimensions,"This paper describes a new finite‐difference form for simulating the behavior of telluric fields near electrical inhomogeneities. The technique involves a local integration of the electric current density crossing a closed surface surrounding a mesh node. To illustrate the concept, a two‐dimensional (2-D) model is considered, but it is readily possible to generalize to three dimensions. The resulting expressions, which are accurate to second degree everywhere, have the form of nine‐point finite‐difference operators, but they have a higher precision than those derived from the usual differential forms which result in five‐point operators. In particular, the new form accounts for cross‐derivative (∂2U/∂x∂z) effects in the region about each node. Including this term can provide significant improvements in accuracy near sharp, localized discontinuities, where the anomalous field decays rapidly (as 1/r or 1/r2) with distance. An analytical solution is compared to finite‐difference calculations using both the conventional five‐point differential form and the new nine‐point integral form developed here. The results suggest that, in some cases, one might expect at least a factor of three improvement when using the nine‐point operator instead of the five‐point operator. This is particularly true in the vicinity of localized structures where the curvilinear character of the distorted field is most pronounced and one would expect the cross‐derivative term to be large.",10.1190/1.1441350
Directional Filtering For Linear Feature Enhancement In Geophysical Maps,"Geophysical maps of data acquired in ground and airborne surveys are extensively used for mineral, groundwater, and petroleum exploration. Lineaments in these maps are often indicative of contacts, basement faulting, and other tectonic features of interest. To aid the interpretation of these maps, a versatile processing technique of directional filtering, based on the 2-D ""normal"" Radon transform, is used to enhance or suppress specific lineaments. Synthetic data and field examples using electromagnetic and radiometric data are used to demonstrate the superiority of the Radon transform method over conventional Fourier transform filtering. The Radon transform technique is shown to be more versatile and less susceptible to processing artefacts than the Fourier transform methods.",10.1190/1.1444860
"Mapping Of The Resistivity, Susceptibility, And Permittivity Of The Earth Using A Helicopter‐Borne Electromagnetic System","Interpretation of helicopter‐borne electromagnetic (EM) data is commonly based on the mapping of resistivity (or conductivity) under the assumption that the magnetic permeability is that of free space and dielectric permittivity can be ignored. However, the data obtained from a multifrequency EM system may contain information about the magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity as well as the conductivity. Our previous work has shown how helicopter EM data may be transformed to yield the resistivity and magnetic permeability or, alternatively, the resistivity and dielectric permittivity. A method has now been developed to recover the resistivity, magnetic permeability, and dielectric permittivity together from the transformation of helicopter EM data based on a half‐space model. A field example is presented from an area which exhibits both permeable and dielectric properties. This example shows that the mapping of resistivity, magnetic permeability, and dielectric permittivity together yields more credible results than if the permeability or permittivity is ignored.",10.1190/1.1444889
Electric Field Of An Oscillating Dipole On The Surface Of A Two Layer Earth,"The electric field of a low frequency oscillator placed on the surface of a two layer earth is determined in two special cases, namely, the case in which the conductivities of the two layers are nearly equal, and the case in which the lower layer is a perfect insulator; in the latter case, only terms of zero and first order in frequency are considered. It is shown that, when the upper layer is sufficiently thin or is very thick, the mutual inductance of two wire elements on the surface of a two layer earth has the same value as for a homogeneous earth. In the case of an insulated layer, it is shown that the maximum departure of the value of mutual inductance of two collinear wire elements from the corresponding value on a homogeneous earth is 35%.",10.1190/1.1437282
Adaptive Learning 3D Gravity Inversion For Salt-Body Imaging,"We have developed an iterative scheme for inverting gravity data produced by salt bodies with density contrasts relative to the sediments varying from positive to negative, crossing, in this way, the nil zone. Our inversion method estimates a 3D density-contrast distribution, through a piecewise constant function defined on a user-specified grid of cells. It consists of two nested iterative loops. The outer loop uses an adaptive learning strategy that starts with a coarse grid of cells, a set of first-guess geometric elements (axes and points) and the corresponding assigned density contrasts. From the second iteration on, this strategy refines the grid and automatically creates a new set of geometric elements (points only) and associated density contrasts. Each geometric element operates as the first-guess skeletal outline of a section of the salt body to be imaged. The inner loop estimates the 3D density-contrast distribution for the grid of cells and for the set of geometric elements defined in the outer loop. The outer loop allows for easy incorporation of prior geologic information about the lithologic units and automatic evolution of the prior information. The inner loop forces the estimated density contrast of each cell to be close either to a null or to a non-null prespecified value. The iteration stops when the geometries of the estimated salt bodies are invariant along successive iterations. We apply our method to synthetic gravity data produced by a homogeneous salt body embedded in heterogeneous sediments. We tested two geologic hypotheses about the real gravity data from Galveston Island salt dome, USA. In the first, the estimated salt body attains a maximum bottom depth of 5 km, whereas in the second hypothesis, it is shallower and discloses an overhang. Both solutions fit the data and are feasible geologically, so both hypotheses are acceptable.",10.1190/1.3555078
"2D Reflection Seismic Investigations At The Kevitsa Ni-Cu-Pge Deposit, Northern Finland","In 2007, a 2D reflection seismic survey was conducted at the Kevitsa Ni-Cu-PGE (platinum group elements) deposit in northern Finland. The aims of the survey were to delineate the overall extent of the ore-bearing Kevitsa ultramafic intrusive complex, to study the seismic response of the disseminated ore deposit, to potentially find indications for new ore deposits, and to extract structural information at depth that may be associated with mineralization. In the processing sequence, specific focus was given to finding optimal CDP-line geometries for the crooked-line survey profiles and, due to highly variable bedrock velocities, to detailed velocity analysis. Our conventional processing sequence, involving prestack DMO corrections followed by poststack migration, resulted in high-quality images of the subsurface. First, the data were used to establish the shape and extent of the Kevitsa intrusion, thus providing an overall framework for future exploration in the area. In particular, the data suggest deeper, up to about 1.5 km depth, continuation of the intrusion than previously thought. Furthermore, the images reveal variable reflectivity characteristics within the intrusion from nonreflective to internally reflective. The Kevitsa deposit is located within a part of the intrusion which is associated with distinct, gently dipping reflectivity fabric down to a depth of about 1 km, spatially constrained within a restricted zone internal to the intrusion. This zone can be used as a guideline for the near-mine exploration efforts, and the reflectivity is dominantly associated with magmatic layering controlling the extent of the bulk of economic mineralization. The seismic data also reveal a complex pattern of faults, in particular a series of major fault and shear zones bracketing and crosscutting the Kevitsa intrusion as a whole. Additionally, our interpretation of the data indicates a possible shared origin of the Kevitsa intrusion and the nearby Satovaara intrusion.",10.1190/geo2011-0496.1
"""Refraction Waves Reflected From A Fault Zone""","Many records of a reflection project in Webb County, Texas, displayed events showing excessive step‐out times. These events are treated as refraction waves following a near‐surface marker horizon, and their origin is shown to be associated with faulting which was mapped by the ordinary reflections on the records. Possible confusion that may arise from failing to recognize these anomalous events is discussed as well as the possibility of using the phenomenon to map faults.",10.1190/1.1437201
Visible And Near‐Infrared Spectra Of Rocks From Chromium‐Rich Areas,"Bidirectional reflection spectra are presented from 0.35 to 2.5 μm for a suite of ultramafic rocks collected from chromium‐rich areas in southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. Features due to the presence of chromium are entirely absent from these spectra. However, the massive chromite samples are distinguishable from all others on the basis of spectral features produced by absorptions in ferrous ions located in unique tetrahedral sites afforded by the chromite spinel structure. Chromite samples are also distinguishable by their lack of specific absorption near 1.0 μm, normally caused by ferrous ions located in octahedral sites; absorption in the 1.0 μm region is the typical situation found in ultramafic and mafic rocks. The potential usefulness for remote‐sensing purposes of this unusual spectral regime is suggested.",10.1190/1.1440978
Estimating The Boundary Surface Between Geologic Formations From 3D Seismic Data Using Neural Networks And Geostatistics,"The exact locations of horizons that separate geologic sequences are known only at physically sampled locations (e.g., borehole intersections), which, in general, are very sparse. 3D seismic data, on the other hand, provide complete coverage of a volume of interest with the possibility of detecting the boundaries between formations with, for example, contrasted acoustic impedance. Detection of boundaries is hampered, however, by coarse spatial resolution of the seismic data, together with local variability of acoustic impedance within formations. The authors propose a two-part approach to the problem, using neural networks and geostatistics. First, an artificial neural network is used for boundary detection. The training set for the neural net comprises seismic traces that are collocated with the borehole locations. Once the net is trained, it is applied to the entire seismic grid. Second, output from the neural network is processed geostatistically to filter noise and to assess the uncertainty of the boundary locations. A physical counterpart is interpreted for each structure inferred from the spatial semivariogram. Factorial kriging is used for filtering, and uncertainty in the shape of the boundaries is assessed by geostatistical simulation. In this approach, the boundary locations are interpreted as random functions that can be simulated to incorporate their uncertainty in applications. A case study of boundary detection between sandstone and breccia formations in a highly faulted zone is used to illustrate the methodologies.",10.1190/1.1852783
Detection Of Guided Waves Between Gas Wells For Reservoir Characterization,"Guided seismic waves can be used to predict continuity and discontinuity of reservoir structures between wells, with the low‐velocity beds acting as waveguides. We relate guided‐wave signatures to waveguide targets using experimental data acquired at the Stratton gas field in southeast Texas. The observed seismic data indicate the presence of trapped energy in low velocity shale markers between wells 145 and 151. Guided waves in the form of leaky modes are excited, transmitted, and detected in the low‐velocity shale markers at a well separation of 1730 ft (527 m). Dispersion analysis, modeling, frequency–amplitude depth curves, well logs, and lithological information all support the results. Specifically, the characterization of two low‐velocity shale markers, V2 and V5, demonstrates that V2 is more heterogeneous than V5 between the source well 151 and detector well 145. Finally, images of synthetic and real data show the potential applications of the guided‐wave technology as a tool for reservoir characterization.",10.1190/1.1451322
One-Step Wave Extrapolation Matrix Method For Reverse Time Migration,"We have developed a new method for solving the acoustic full-wave equation, which we call the one-step wave extrapolation (OSE) matrix method. In our method, the wave equation is redefined by introducing a complex (analytic) wavefield and reformulating the traditional acoustic full-wave equation as a first-order partial differential equation in time. Afterward, the analytical wavefield is separated to its real and imaginary parts, and the resulting first-order coupled set of equations is solved by the Tal-Ezer's technique, which consists of using the Chebyshev polynomial expansion to approximate the matrix exponential operator. The matrix is antisymmetrical with a square-root pseudodifferential operator, which is computed using the Fourier method. In this way, the implementation of the proposed method is straightforward and if the appropriate number of Chebyshev polynomial expansion terms is chosen, the proposed numerical algorithm is unconditionally stable and propagates seismic waves free of numerical dispersion for any seismic velocity variation in a recursive manner. Moreover, in our method, the number of Fourier transforms is explicitly determined and it is a function of the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix operator and time-step size. A numerical modeling example is shown to demonstrate that the proposed method has the capability to extrapolate waves using a time stepping up to Nyquist limit. We have also developed a reverse time migration example with illumination compensation. The migration results based on the OSE method demonstrate the capability of this new method to image complex structures in the presence of strong velocity contrasts.",10.1190/geo2015-0555.1
A Generalized Form Of Snell'S Law In Anisotropic Media,"We have reformulated the law governing the refraction of rays at a planar interface separating two anisotropic media in terms of slowness surfaces. Equations connecting ray directions and phase‐slowness angles are derived using geometrical properties of the gradient operator in slowness space. A numerical example shows that, even in weakly anisotropic media, the ray trajectory governed by the anisotropic Snell's law is significantly different from that obtained using the isotropic form. This could have important implications for such considerations as imaging (e.g., migration) and lithology analysis (e.g., amplitude variation with offset). Expressions are shown specifically for compressional (qP) waves but they can easily be extended to SH waves by equating the anisotropic parameters (i.e., ε = δ ⇒ γ) and to qSV and converted waves by similar means. The analytic expressions presented are more complicated than the standard form of Snell's law. To facilitate practical application, we include our Mathematica code.",10.1190/1.1444759
Survey Decomposition: A Scalable Framework For 3D Controlled-Source Electromagnetic Inversion,"Numerical modeling and inversion of electromagnetic (EM) data is a computationally intensive task. To achieve efficiency, we have developed algorithms that were constructed from a smallest practical computational unit. This ""atomic"" building block, which yields the solution of Maxwell's equations for a single time or frequency datum due to an infinitesimal current or magnetic dipole, is a self-contained EM problem that can be solved independently and inexpensively on a single core of CPU. Any EM data set can be composed from these units through assembling or superposition. This approach takes advantage of the rapidly expanding capability of multiprocessor computation. Our decomposition has allowed us to handle the computational complexity that arises because of the physical size of the survey, the large number of transmitters, and the large range of time or frequency in a data set; we did this by modeling every datum separately on customized local meshes and local time-stepping schemes. The counterpart to efficiency with atomic decomposition was that the number of independent subproblems could become very large. We have realized that not all of the data need to be considered at all stages of the inversion. Rather, the data can be significantly downsampled at late times or low frequencies and at the early stages of inversion when only long-wavelength signals are sought. We have therefore developed a random data subsampling approach, in conjunction with cross-validation, that selects data in accordance to the spatial scales of the EM induction and the degree of regularization. Alternatively, for many EM surveys, the atomic units can be combined into larger subproblems, thus reducing the number of subproblems needed. These trade-offs were explored for airborne and ground large-loop systems with specific survey configurations being considered. Our synthetic and field examples showed that the proposed framework can produce 3D inversion results in uncompromised quality in a more scalable manner.",10.1190/geo2015-0217.1
Anisotropic Parsimonious Prestack Depth Migration,"An efficient Kirchhoff-style prestack depth migration, called ""parsimonious"" migration, was developed a decade ago for isotropic 2D and 3D media by using measured slownesses to reduce the amount of ray tracing by orders of magnitude. It is conceptually similar to ""map"" migration, but its implementation has some differences. We have extended this approach to 2D tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media and illustrated it with synthetic P-wave data. Although the framework of isotropic parsimonious may be retained, the extension to TTI media requires redevelopment of each of the numerical components, calculation of the phase and group velocity for TTI media, development of a new two-point anisotropic ray tracer, and substitution of an initial-angle isotropic shooting ray-trace algorithm for an anisotropic one. The model parameterization consists of Thomsen's parameters (VP0, ε, δ) and the tilt angle of the symmetry axis of the TI medium. The parsimonious anisotropic migration algorithm is successfully applied to synthetic data from a TTI version of the Marmousi2 model. The quality of the image improves by weighting the impulse response by the calculation of the anisotropic Fresnel radius. The accuracy and speed of this migration makes it useful for anisotropic velocity model building. The elapsed computing time for 101 shots for the Marmousi2 TTI model is 35 s per shot (each with 501 traces) in 32 Opteron cores.",10.1190/geo2011-0408.1
A Theoretical Study Of Surface‐To‐Borehole Electromagnetic Logging In Cased Holes,"A new electromagnetic logging method, in which the source is a horizontal loop coaxial with a cased drill hole and the secondary axial fields are measured at depth within the casing, has been analyzed. The analysis, which is for an idealized model of an infinite pipe in a conductive whole space, has shown that the casing and formation are uncoupled at the low frequencies that would be used in field studies. The field inside the casing may be found by first finding the field in the formation and then using this field as an incident field for the pipe alone. This result permits the formation response to be recovered from the measured field in the borehole by applying a correction for the known properties of the casing. If the casing response cannot be accurately predicted, a separate logging tool employing a higher frequency transmitter could be used to determine the required casing parameters in the vicinity of the receiver. This logging technique shows excellent sensitivity to changes in formation conductivity, but it is not yet known how well horizontal stratification can be resolved. One of its most promising applications will be in monitoring, through repeated measurements, changes in formation conductivity during production or enhanced recovery operations.",10.1190/1.1442581
Multicomponent Prestack Depth Migration By Scalar Wavefield Extrapolation,"The multicomponent migration results in our synthetic examples demonstrate that even for a single shot gather, we can obtain clean PP‐ and PS‐wave images over complex structures and resolve the problem of PS‐wave polarity reversals.",10.1190/1.1527088
Avo Inversion Of A Gulf Of Mexico Bright Spot—A Case Study,"An iterative and linearized inversion algorithm carried out in the x-t domain has been applied to a prestack seismic data set from the central Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana. Sonic and density curves from a well located close to the seismic line are used to generate the initial starting models for the inversion. We tested the geologically realistic hypothesis that the starting models have an accurate impedance structure outside of the potential pay zone and that the prospective pay zone will have mechanical properties consistent with the presence or absence of hydrocarbons. The inversion, performed with starting models with pay zones with a Poisson's ratio appropriate for 100% brine saturation or with a Poisson's ratio intermediate between expected values for full brine and hydrocarbon saturation, does not converge to the real seismic gather. However, with a starting model having a Poisson's ratio appropriate for hydrocarbon saturation in the target zone, there is convergence from the initial to the real seismic gather.",10.1190/1.1444652
Migration Velocity Analysis In Factorized Vti Media,"To find the depth scale of the section and build a model for prestack depth migration using the MVA results, the vertical velocity VP0 needs to be specified for at least a single point in each block. When no borehole information about VP0 is available, a well‐focused image can often be obtained by assuming that the vertical‐velocity field is continuous across layer boundaries. A synthetic test for a three‐layer model with a syncline structure confirms the accuracy of our MVA algorithm in estimating the interval parameters Vnmo, kz, kx, and η and illustrates the influence of errors in the vertical velocity on the image quality.",10.1190/1.1759457

Attenuation And Dispersion Of Compressional Waves In Fluid‐Filled Porous Rocks With Partial Gas Saturation (White Model)—Part I: Biot Theory,"An exact theory of attenuation and dispersion of seismic waves in porous rocks containing spherical gas pockets (White model) is presented using the coupled equations of motion given by Biot. Assumptions made are (1) the acoustic wavelength is long with respect to the distance between gas pockets and their size, and (2) the gas pockets do not interact. Thus, the present theory essentially is quite similar to that proposed by White (1975), but the problem of the radially oscillating gas pocket is solved in a more rigorous manner by means of Biot's theory (1962). The solid‐fluid coupling is automatically included, and the model is solved as a boundary value problem requiring all radial stresses and displacements to be continuous at the gas‐brine interface. Thus, we do not require any assumed fluid‐pressure discontinuity at the gas‐water contact, such as the one employed by White (1975). We have also presented an analysis of all of the field variables in terms of Biot's type I (the classical compressional) wave and, type II (the diffusion) wave. Our quantitative results are presented in Dutta and Odé (1979, this issue).",10.1190/1.1440938
Automatic Gravity Optimization Of 2.5D Strike Listric Fault Sources With Analytically Defined Fault Planes And Depth-Dependent Density,"An automatic gravity inversion technique in the space domain simultaneously estimates the parameters of strike-limited listric fault sources and regional gravity background from a set of observed Bouguer gravity anomalies. The fault profile and regional effect are described by unknown polynomial functions of arbitrary but prescribed degree. Furthermore, the density contrast within the fault structure is presumed to be known, according to a prescribed parameterized nonlinear function of depth, in geologic settings where the detached downthrown block consists of a series of sedimentary beds whose density increases with depth. The inversion is automatic in that it initializes and determines polynomial coefficients for the fault boundary and regional gravity background from a set of observed Bouguer gravity anomalies and improves them iteratively until the modeled gravity anomalies mimic the observed anomalies. An analysis of a set of gravity anomalies attributable to a synthetic model of a listric fault structure in the presence of pseudorandom noise with and without regional background has disclosed that the algorithm yields reliable interpretations with modest error in model geometry, even in the presence of pseudorandom noise. In the presence of regional gravity background and pseudorandom noise, the estimated parameters of the structure deviate marginally from the true ones. The derived density-depth model of the Jharia coal basin in India, a pull-apart basin, has been used to analyze the observed Bouguer gravity anomalies of a boundary fault. The interpretation has yielded information consistent with drilling results and geologic setting of the basin.",10.1190/1.3541957
Viscoelastic Finite‐Difference Modeling,"Real earth media disperse and attenuate propagating mechanical waves. This anelastic behavior can be described well by a viscoelastic model. We have developed a finite‐difference simulator to model wave propagation in viscoelastic media. The finite‐difference method was chosen in favor of other methods for several reasons. Finite‐difference codes are more portable than, for example, pseudospectral codes. Moreover, finite‐difference schemes provide a convenient environment in which to define complicated boundaries. A staggered scheme of second‐order accuracy in time and fourth‐order accuracy in space appears to be optimally efficient. Because of intrinsic dispersion, no fixed grid points per wavelength rule can be given; instead, we present tables, which enable a choice of grid parameters for a given level of accuracy. Since the scheme models energy absorption, natural and efficient absorbing boundaries may be implemented merely by changing the parameters near the grid boundary. The viscoelastic scheme is only marginally more expensive than analogous elastic schemes. The efficient implementation of absorbing boundaries may therefore be a good reason for also using the viscoelastic scheme in purely elastic simulations. We illustrate our method and the importance of accurately modeling anelastic media through 2-D and 3-D examples from shallow marine environments.",10.1190/1.1443701
Generalized Form Of The Dix Equation For The Calculation Of Interval Velocities And Layer Thicknesses,"Over three decades ago, Dix (1955) derived an approximate equation for the determination of interval velocity from observed reflection seismic data. Assuming a stack of m horizontal layers, with interval velocities Uj, layer thicknesses ΔZj, j = 1, m, and near‐vertical raypaths, Dix (1955) showed that ",10.1190/1.1442693
Wire-Loop Surface Conductor For Airborne Em System Testing,"The known mineral deposits used to test and compare airborne electromagnetic systems are often difficult to model because of nonideal geology, and may also be inconvenient or costly to survey. A simple wire-loop conductor has the advantage of being easily transported to the survey location and can be tuned to deliver a range of responses that will closely match the theoretical response, particularly on resistive ground. We calculated the response for such a tuned loop laid out at the surface of conductive ground and compared that response to field data. For an AEM system flown over a surface loop, when neglecting the second order of mutual induction, the receiver signal can be divided into three parts: (1) transmitter-earth-receiver (TER) signal; (2) transmitter-loop-receiver (TLR) signal; and (3) loop-earth-receiver (LER) signal. While the TER response has been extensively addressed in the literature, we modeled the more complex case of TLR and LER system responses. We first calculated the mutual inductance between the transmitter and the surface loop, tak-ing the loop impedance (resistance and inductance) into account, and then we calculated the signal in the receiver by calculating the mutual inductance between the loop and the receiver. To calculate the LER response, we divided the surface loop into a series of transmitting dipoles, with the ""transmitting"" current in the dipoles obtained by analyzing the mutual induction between the transmitter and loop. The numerical experiments show that the free-space wire-loop response (TLR system) displays the standard exponential decay for a conductor. The loop resistance and inductance define the decay constant and initial signal value. While the TER system largely influences the receiver signal at early time channels for conductive earth, the LER system influences very late time channels. The more resistive the test ground is, the longer the time window is for the free-space wire-loop signal to dominate. For the survey over a test loop on conductive ground in the Dominican Republic, using the Fugro HeliGEOTEM system, the predicted response compares well to the collected data.",10.1190/1.3008055
Induced-Polarization Detection And Mapping Of Contaminant Plumes,"Several laboratory and scaled model investigations suggest that organic contaminants affect the surface electrical properties of exposed soils/rocks and therefore produce measurable induced polarization (IP) signatures. However, there is little field evidence of an IP methodology for contaminant mapping. A 2D time-domain IP method is developed for mapping the FS-12 contaminant plume at the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR) located in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The FS-12 plume consists of approximately   265  m3    of fuel that erupted from a broken underground pipeline in the early 1970s. Benzene and ethylene dibromide (EDB) are the primary contaminants at FS-12, with concentrations exceeding the allowed maximum concentration levels (MCL), while other constituents of the plume did not exceed their MCL. Therefore, the contaminants of interest are benzene and EDB, partly because of their health risk and partly because they present the highest concentrations (2400 and   1000 μg∕L  , respectively) among the plume constituents and are therefore more likely to be related to the polarization source. IP data were acquired along a survey line that partially transects the plume extending over contaminated and uncontaminated zones and were inverted to give 2D resistivity and chargeability plots to   100 m   depth and a horizontal extent of   400 m  . By separately inverting IP data derived from time windows located at short and long decay times, a time-domain gross (spectral) chargeability difference is produced. Both the chargeability and gross spectral chargeability difference show good agreement with the known location of the plume from monitoring wells, with the IP chargeability section suggesting contaminant distribution detail that cannot otherwise be inferred from the sparse borehole distribution.",10.1190/1.2196873
Lithology Discrimination For Thin Layers Using Wavelet Signal Parameters,"A forward modeling technique using Ricker wavelets demonstrates the need for a multiparameter approach in lithology determination using reflections from thin layers. The combination of time‐ and frequency‐domain analyses leads to a set of algorithms which define pore fluid and lithology from wavelet characteristics. The dispersive behavior of the thin layer varies considerably with the environment surrounding the layer, resulting in characteristic frequency‐domain behavior. With a limited prior knowledge of the formation environment, the pore fluid type can be determined using mode‐converted waves in the frequency domain.",10.1190/1.1442432
Near-Surface Resistivity Contrast Mapping With A Capacitive Sensor Array And An Inductive Source,"Electromagnetic survey methodology is adapted to use the electric component to directly detect buried resistors and map resistivity contrasts in the near surface. System implementations do not require ground contact because they use capacitive electric-field sensors and an inductive source and may be operated at walking pace. This study outlined theoretical basis, computational modeling, and verification for the methodology. The systems are designed to operate at low enough frequency that any responses are at the resistive limit; as such, the electric fields they measure are insensitive to horizontal layering and absolute conductivity. A surface integral equation algorithm is used to model regular discrete objects in a half-space. Anomalies are controlled by geometry and lateral resistivity contrast rather than by absolute resistivity values. A prototype electrode array system called CARIS 1 reliably detects resistive objects submerged in a saltwater tank, and the measured responses are consistent with numerical modeling. These results provided the basis for further development of the CARIS II system with flexible geometry that is adaptable to detect resistive or conductive targets in any background environment. CARIS is designed to be useful where conventional electromagnetics, ground-penetrating radar, and conventional resistivity face difficulties or fail, and it has easily detected a range of buried targets in the near surface. However, it is quite sensitive to disturbed ground and surface undulation and inhomogeneity.",10.1190/1.3553480
"3-D Viscoelastic Anisotropic Modeling Of Data From A Multicomponent, Multiazimuth Seismic Experiment In Northeast Texas","Three‐component seismic data were acquired along six azimuths at a site in northeast Texas. Sources were inclined impacts combined to produce equivalent vertical and crossline horizontal components. The data were analyzed by iterative modeling using a new 3-D, staggered‐grid, finite‐differencing scheme. The 3-D model is defined in terms of spatially variable anisotropic, viscoelastic parameters (P‐velocity, S‐velocity, density, Qp, and Qs) and converted to elastic tensor components and relaxation times for computation. Simultaneous fitting of amplitudes of near‐surface reverberations, surface waves, converted waves, and deeper reflections gives an anisotropic, viscoelastic model that provides constraints on earth properties. The assumption of transverse isotropy in previous experiments is supported by the results of this experiment. The final model consists of a stack of flat layers, each of which has isotropic P‐velocity, Qp, and Qs. The Wills Point and Kincaid shales are strongly transversely isotropic, with shear propagation velocity averaging 28% higher horizontally than vertically. The geometry of the Nacatoch Sandstone is similar, with ≈19% anisotropy. The marls and chalks are essentially isotropic. Observed mixing between crossline and vertical components is incorporated by simulating a small (4°) tilt of the axis of the impact source from vertical.",10.1190/1.1443841
Interactive 2D Magnetic Inversion: A Tool For Aiding Forward Modeling And Testing Geologic Hypotheses,"We present a method for inverting magnetic data with interfering anomalies produced by multiple complex 2D magnetic sources having arbitrary shapes and known magnetization vectors. Our method is stable and can recover a complex 2D magnetization distribution, leading to a reliable delineation of sectionally homogeneous sources with complex shapes. Our method, although similar to interactive forward modeling, is unique in that it automatically fits the observations and only requires that the interpreter know the outlines of the sources expressed by simple geometric elements such as points and line segments. Each geometric element operates as a skeletal outline of a particular homogeneous section of the magnetic source to be reconstructed. Also, the interpreter can define the geometric elements interactively without worrying about data fitting because data are fit automatically. The examples with synthetic data illustrate the good performance of the method in mapping the complex geometry of magnetic sources. The solution sensitivity to uncertainties in the a priori information shows that to produce good results, the uncertainty on the magnetization intensity of each homogeneous extent of the source should be smaller than 40%. A wrong magnetization vector direction can be detected easily because it often leads to poor data fitting and to estimated sources with abrupt borders. The method is also applied to two sets of real data from the Northwest Ore Body at Iron Mountain Mine, Missouri, and the Hatton-Rockall Basin in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. The estimated magnetization distribution in all tests demonstrates a good correlation of estimated magnetic sources with corresponding known geologic features.",10.1190/1.2258093
"A Seismic Analysis Of Black Creek And Wabumun Salt Collapse Features, Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin","Two Devonian salts of western Canada, those of the Black Creek member (Upper Elk Point subgroup) in northwest Alberta and those of the Wabamun group in southeastern Alberta, were widely distributed and uniformly deposited within their respective basins. Both of these salts are interbedded within predominantly carbonate sequences and both have been extensively leached. They are now preserved as discontinuous remnants of variable thickness and areal extent. These salt remnants and their associated collapse features are often associated with structural or stratigraphic traps. Structural traps typically form where reservoir facies are closed across remnant salts, stratigraphic traps often develop where reservoir facies were either preferentially deposited and/or preserved in salt collapse lows. As a result of these relationships between dissolution and hydrocarbon entrapment, the distribution (areal extent and thickness) of these salt remnants is of significant interest to the explorationist. Both the Black Creek and Wabamun salts have relatively abrupt contacts with the encasing higher velocity, higher density carbonates. Where these salts are sufficiently thick, their top and base typically generate high amplitude reflections, and lateral variations in the salt isopach can be directly determined from the seismic data. Relative salt thicknesses can also be indirectly estimated through analyses of lateral variations in the thicknesses of the encompassing carbonates, time structural drape and velocity pullup. Such seismic information about the thickness and the extent of these salts should be used together with well log control to generate subsurface distribution maps. These maps will facilitate both the delineation of prospective structural and stratigraphic play fairways and the determination of the timing of salt dissolution. In addition, an appreciation of regional salt distribution will decrease the likelihood that remnant salts will be misinterpreted as either reefs and/or faulted structures.",10.1190/1.1443078
Key Elements Of Total Seismic Field Design Using Mathematica—A Tutorial,"This tutorial reviews the basics of total seismic field design and provides personal‐computer–based computer language codes that can readily be used, with some modification, to design seismic surveys in the field. The finite effective dynamic range of seismic recording systems together with an overlap of signal and noise spectra suggest that a certain amount of prefiltering is needed during the acquisition phase to insure that a weak signal does not fall below the system noise, which would render the signal useless. The key elements of a total seismic field design are reviewed and, by way of a hypothetical 3‐D field example, their implementation is illustrated. The recommended solution consists of parameters for spread geometry that will record maximum geologic dips without aliasing, and shot and receiver arrays that optimize the signal‐to‐noise ratio.",10.1190/1.1500362
Crosswell Electromagnetic And Seismic Imaging: An Examination Of Coincident Surveys At A Steam Flood Project,"We studied crosswell electromagnetic and seismic images of three oil‐saturated intervals within a southern California heavy oil field undergoing steam flood. The crosswell survey is located in a portion of the field where one well is in a ""cold spot,"" resulting in differing steam propagation within the three units. Log analysis shows linear or second‐order polynomial relationships (with correlation coefficients greater than 0.7) between electrical conductivity and water saturation, porosity, and clay content; whereas only a weakly linear relationship can be found between velocity and temperature in the lower unit studied. Crosswell seismic data is used to produce a velocity tomogram and a reflection section, and crosswell electromagnetic data is used to produce a conductivity section and derived porosity and water saturation. The seismic velocities from the tomograms show lateral variations consistent with the lateral variations in temperature seen in observation wells on either side of the crosswell section. The continuity and disruption of seismic reflections coincide with zones of continuous and variable porosity and water saturation as produced from the crosswell electromagnetic inverted conductivity section, and the derived regression fits between conductivity and porosity/water saturation. Seismic velocities, reflections, electrical conductivity, and the derived porosity and water saturation sections all contribute to explaining the observed lateral temperature variations between the wells within the three reservoir units. The unit with high steam content has low water saturation, high porosity, and laterally continuous low‐velocity and seismic reflections, consistent with no barriers to flow. The upper unit, where steam breaks through later in the experiment, also has high porosity and laterally continuous seismic reflections. However, it shows a velocity gradient between the hot and cold wells consistent with the lack of steam in the cold well at the time of the experiment. The middle unit, in which steam never reaches the cold well during the experiment, has the highest water saturation and the largest zone of reduced porosity and disrupted seismic reflections, indicating a possible barrierto flow.",10.1190/1.1707060
Use Of The Wave Height Operational Index In Planning Offshore Gravity Meter Surveys,"Efficiency of offshore gravity meter exploration (stations occupied daily) is analyzed statistically as a function of wave height. For the surveys investigated, the number of stations occupied daily can best be represented by the line of regression, Yc=49.85−8.75X, where X equals wave height (as defined herein), and Yc equals number of stations. Cost of offshore gravity meter surveys is shown to vary as much as 50 percent depending on planning involving sea conditions. Application of forecasts of sea and weather conditions is discussed and savings achieved through their use are demonstrated.",10.1190/1.1437829
Cross‐Borehole Tomography In Anisotropic Media,"Anisotropy has significant effect on traveltime cross‐borehole tomography. Even relatively weak anisotropy cannot be ignored if accurate velocity estimates are desired, since isotropic traveltime tomography treats anisotropy as inhomogeneity. Traveltime data in our examples were synthetically generated by a ray‐tracing code for anisotropic media, and the computed quasi‐P‐wave traveltimes were subsequently inverted using the ""dual tomography"" technique (Carrion, 1991). The results of the tomographic inversion show typical artifacts due to the anisotropy, and that accurate imaging is impossible without taking the anisotropy into account.",10.1190/1.1443333
"Seismic Velocities And Electrical Resistivity Of Recent Volcanics And Their Dependence On Porosity, Temperature, And Water Saturation","Variation of P‐wave velocities and electrical resistivities of several suites of water‐saturated recent volcanics was investigated. Both P‐velocities and resistivities exhibited strong dependence on porosity. Resistivity was also dependent upon degree of water saturation and temperature. P‐wave velocities, while showing a strong dependence on porosity, appear to be independent of water saturation and temperature. Volcanics, in general, exhibit higher resistivities compared to other igneous rocks and sediments. Electric resistivity of fine‐grained basalts is anomalously low, probably due to higher content of disseminated iron. Pyroclastics and volcanic breccia, on the other hand, exhibit higher resistivities in relation to fine‐grained basalts.",10.1190/1.1441148
Electromagnetic Ray‐Trace Tomography,"Electromagnetic (EM) tomography can be used to estimate the distribution of electrical rock properties between boreholes. For typical oil field well spacings and reservoir electrical characteristics, crosswell EM measurements are sensitive primarily to the electrical conductivity, not the permittivity. Ray‐tracing methods normally associated with undamped propagating waves can also be applied to the rapidly attenuated, diffusive EM waves encountered in the petroleum reservoir environment. Thermal noise considerations place an upper limit of approximately 20 skin depths on the separation between wells.",10.1190/1.1443599
Measuring Aem Waveforms With A Ground Loop,"Measuring a transmitter-current waveform provides critical data unavailable for some airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems yet needed to model AEM data quantitatively. We developed a novel experimental method of measuring an airborne transmitter waveform by monitoring the current induced in a closed, multiturn, insulated ground loop of known inductance  L  and resistance  R . The transmitter waveform of five different time-domain systems is deconvolved from the measured ground-loop response when excited by the primary electromagnetic field of the AEM system. In general, our measurements agree well with contractor-described transmitter current waveforms, although crucial differences exist between our deconvolved waveforms and those described in the literature. Using the pulse-per-second feature of a GPS antenna, the ground loop can monitor the frequency drift of a frequency-domain system. The ground loop behaves like a lossy electric-field antenna when the resistance closing the ground loop is too large. This leads to negatives in the response of coincident-loop systems without including induced polarization effects. After observing exponentially decaying, oscillating-current responses in high-resistance ground loops, we model the observed current with an LRC circuit whose resistance and capacitance represent generalized effective antenna and free-space values. Our model predicts responses that closely match the damped oscillations seen in the airborne response during flyover; however, it does not work well on conductive ground.",10.1190/1.2976791

The Effect Of Moisture On The Direct Current Resistivities Of Oil Sands And Rocks,"This paper contains the results of detailed research study to determine the factors which govern the electrical conductivities of oil sands and rocks. The experimental work shows the electrical resistivity to be an inverse function of the percentage of conductive water present in any rock type. It was found that the resistivity‐moisture curve of both petroliferous and non‐petroliferous rock are of a general hyperbolic form. For the higher values of moisture content, the curves rapidly approached the conductivity of the electrolyte contained within the rock or oil sands, while for the lower values of moisture content the resistivity values are high and governed by the properties of the rock. Rocks containing soluble salts have critical points on their resistivity‐moisture curves, with the greatest change occurring in the neighborhood of ten per cent moisture content. Rocks containing fresh water have relatively high resistance values which change fairly uniformly with the variations in moisture content. The research work indicates that the presence of oil does not appreciably effect electrical resistance of the rock. Since the resistivity values are dependent upon the electrolytic effect, the work indicates that resistivity values alone are not a reliable criterion for predicting the presence or absence of an oil sand. The work explains further why high electrical resistivity values are not to be expected when applying electrical geophysical methods for mapping subsurface structure.",10.1190/1.1438064
Numerical Simulation Of The Biot Slow Wave In Water‐Saturated Nivelsteiner Sandstone,"The development of rock acoustic models is important for interpreting seismic data.

"Geophysical History Of The East Field, Jim Hogg County, Texas","The geophysical work which led to the discovery of the East Field in Jim Hogg County, Texas was started in 1934, when a single line of torsion balance stations was run across the area. Core drilling followed in 1938 and 1939. Reflection seismograph work was done in 1942 and outlined the field. The discovery wells were drilled in 1942 and 1943.",10.1190/1.1437313
3D Rotated And Standard Staggered Finite-Difference Solutions To Biot'S Poroelastic Wave Equations: Stability Condition And Dispersion Analysis,"A fourth-order in space and second-order in time 3D staggered (SG) and rotated-staggered-grid (RSG) method for the solution of Biot's equation are presented. The numerical dispersion and stability conditions are derived using a von Neumann analysis. The exact stability condition is calculated from the roots of a 12th-order polynomial and therefore no nontrivial expression exists. To overcome this, a 1D stability condition is usually generalized to three dimensions. It is shown that in certain cases, the 1D approximate stability condition is violated by a 3D SG method. The RSG method obeys the approximate 1D stability condition for the material properties and spatiotemporal scales in the examples shown. Both methods have been verified against an analytical solution for an infinite homogeneous porous medium with a misfit error of less than 0.5%. A free surface has been implement-ed to test the accuracy of this boundary condition. It also serves as a test of the methods to include high material contrasts. The methods have been compared with a quasi-analytical solution. For the specific material properties, spatial grid scaling, and propagation distance used in the test, a maximum error of 3.5% for the SG and 4.1% for the RSG was found. These errors depend on the propagation distance, temporal and spatial scales, and accuracy of the quasi-analytical solution. No discernable difference was found between the two methods except for time steps comparable with the stability-criteria threshold time step, the SG was found to be unstable. However, the RSG remained stable for a homogeneous half-space. Time steps, comparable to the stability criteria, reduce the computational time at the cost of a reduction in accuracy. The methods allow wave propagation to be modeled in a porous medium with a free surface.",10.1190/1.3432759
3-D Seismic Evidence Of The Effects Of Carbonate Karst Collapse On Overlying Clastic Stratigraphy And Reservoir Compartmentalization,"A multidisciplinary team, composed of stratigraphers, petrophysicists, reservoir engineers, and geophysicists, studied a portion of Boonsville gas field in the Fort Worth Basin of north‐central Texas to determine how modern geophysical, geological, and engineering techniques can be combined to understand the mechanisms by which fluvio‐deltaic depositional processes create reservoir compartmentalization in a low‐ to moderate‐accommodation basin. An extensive database involving well logs, cores, production, and pressure data from more than 200 wells, 26mi2 (67km2) of 3-D seismic data, vertical seismic profiles (VSPs), and checkshots was assembled to support this investigation. We found the most important geologic influence on stratigraphy and reservoir compartmentalization in this basin to be the existence of numerous karst collapse chimneys over the 26-mi2 (67km2) area covered by the 3-D seismic grid. These near‐vertical karst collapses originated in, or near, the deep Ordovician‐age Ellenburger carbonate section and created vertical chimneys extending as high as 2500 ft (610 m) above their point of origin, causing significant disruptions in the overlying clastic strata. These karst disruptions tend to be circular in map view, having diameters ranging from approximately 500 ft (150 m) to as much as 3000 ft (915 m) in some cases. Within our study area, these karst features were spaced 2000 ft (610 m) to 6000 ft (1830 m) apart, on average. The tallest karst collapse zones reached into the Middle Pennsylvanian Strawn section, which is some 2500 ft (760 m) above the Ellenburger carbonate where the karst generation began. We used 3-D seismic imaging to show how these karst features affected the strata above the Ellenburger and how they have created a well‐documented reservoir compartment in the Upper Caddo, an upper Atoka valley‐fill sandstone that typically occurs 2000 ft (610 m) above the Ellenburger. By correlating these 3-D seismic images with outcrops of Ellenburger karst collapses, we document that the physical dimensions (height, diameter, cross‐sectional area) of the seismic disruptions observed in the 3-D data equate to the karst dimensions seen in outcrops. We also document that this Ellenburger carbonate dissolution phenomenon extends over at least 500 mi (800 km), and by inference we suggest karst models like we describe here may occur in any basin that has a deep, relatively thick section of Paleozoic carbonates that underlie major unconformities.",10.1190/1.1444057
Modeling Of Low‐Frequency Stoneley‐Wave Propagation In An Irregular Borehole,"A fast modeling method is formulated for low‐frequency Stoneley‐wave propagation in an irregular borehole. This fast modeling method provides synthetic waveforms which include the effects of two borehole irregularities, diameter changes (washout), and formation property changes. The essential physics of the low‐frequency Stoneley waves are captured with a simple 1-D model. A mass‐balance boundary condition and a propagator matrix are used to express Stoneley‐wave interactions with the borehole irregularities. The accuracy of the proposed method was confirmed through comparison with existing finite‐difference and boundary integral modeling methods that yielded cross‐correlations greater than 0.98. Comparison of synthetic records calculated for an actual borehole with field records showed qualitative agreement in the major reflections because of the washout zones, but showed some disagreements in the reflections caused by the fractures. Since the synthetic records include only information relating to the borehole geometry and the elastic properties of formation, the reflection caused by the fracture will appear only in the field record. These results suggest the possibility of distinguishing Stoneley‐wave reflections caused by fractures from those caused by borehole irregularities. Further, the fast computational speed of this method—over 300 times faster than either boundary integral or finite‐difference methods—makes it quite suitable for field application.",10.1190/1.1444206
"Coal Seismic Surveying Over Near-Surface Basalts: Experience From Central Queensland, Australia","Seismic reflection surveying in basalt-covered areas often fails to image underlying reflectors. To gain insights into the nature of the problem and obtain potential solutions, we have conducted experimental 2D seismic reflection and offset VSP surveys at two coal mines in the Bowen Basin of Australia. At the first mine, the basalt is relatively deep (114 m) and relatively thin (20 m). Conventional seismic acquisition and processing of a 2D seismic line provide poor results. However, upgoing reflections from layers below the basalt are clearly evident in the VSP survey and prestack depth migration is able to improve the continuity of the reflectors beneath the basalt. At the second mine, the 360 m wide basalt is at a depth of 40 m and has a thickness of about 40 m. It is fresh and unweathered and consists of multiple flows which are interlayered with unconsolidated sediments. Long-offset data acquisition combined with prestack depth migration was expected to produce satisfactory results but this is not the case. The associated VSP survey suggests that the problems at this mine are due to (1) the generation of complex downgoing and upgoing wave-fields within the basalt and (2) significant scattering of surface waves from outside the basalt at the margins of the basalt. Another problem is that the target coal seams are at about 300 m depth and the muting required to remove refraction events limited the effectiveness of the prestack depth migration. Reducing the strength of the surface waves through selection of an appropriate source and placement of shots at the base of the low-velocity zone (as had been the case at the first mine) will therefore improve the chances for a successful outcome. A Vibroseis survey subsequently undertaken at the second mine, which produced shot records with reduced surface waves, shows this to be the case.",10.1190/geo2013-0259.1
Recursive Prestack Depth Migration Using Cfp Gathers,"The common-focus-point technology (CFP) describes prestack migration by focusing in two steps: emission and detection. The output of the first focusing step represents a CFP gather. This gather defines a shot record that represents the subsurface response resulting from a focused source wavefield. We propose applying the recursive shot-record, depth-migration algorithm to the CFP gathers of a seismic data volume and refer to this process as CFP-gather migration. In the situation of complex geology and/or low signal-to-noise ratio, CFP-based image gathers are easier to interpret for nonalignment than the conventional image gathers. This makes the CFP-based image gathers better suited for velocity analysis. This important property is illustrated by examples on the Marmousi model.",10.1190/1.2348517
Dual Wavefields From Distributed Acoustic Sensing Measurements,"Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) using fiber optic cables is an emerging seismic acquisition technology for the oil and gas industry, geothermal resource exploration, and underground fluid-storage monitoring. This technology offers the advantage of improving seismic acquisition by enabling massive arrays for monitoring of seismic wavefields at reduced cost with respect to conventional methods. In general, it is accepted that this method provides acoustic signals comparable with conventional seismic data, however, without the multicomponent directional information typical of geophones. We have developed a modified data extraction method and found that, as a result of the dense spatial distribution of recording points along the optic cable, DAS can provide two linked wavefield components in the axial direction, even when using a single 1D cable line. These signal pairs consist of dual components that are related to native strain rate (or strain) and particle acceleration (or velocity) fields at a given recording location. These dual signals are easily usable for wavefield separation purposes simply performing a trace-by-trace combination by appropriate scaling coefficient. The analysis performed with borehole data from linear and helically wound cables demonstrates the effectiveness of polarity recovery and dual-wavefield separation. We show real examples in which the data can be combined to provide separation of up- and downgoing wavefields. The ratio of the dual components provides information on local slowness properties in the formation.",10.1190/geo2016-0073.1
"Inversion Of Self‐Potential Data From The Cerro Prieto Geothermal Field, Mexico","Self‐potential (SP) data from the Cerro Prieto geothermal field in Baja California, Mexico have been inverted using a model consisting of a vertical contact separating regions of different electrical properties. A temperature source is assumed to coincide with the vertical contact between materials with different thermoelectric coupling coefficients. A derivative‐free Levenberg‐Marquardt algorithm is used to estimate values for the depth, vertical extent, length, and intensity of the source region. The depth to the top of the source is estimated to be about 1.3 ± 0.2 km, which agrees quite well with the depth to the top of the production zone determined from drilling. The vertical extent and length of the source region are estimated to be 11 ± 3 km and 9.9 ± 0.4 km, respectively. There appears to be geologic evidence for the presence of a fault or fault zone within the geothermal field that roughly coincides in location with the self‐potential source region. The conductivity on the east side of the production zone is estimated to be 80 percent of the value to the west, which is in general agreement with field resistivity measurements. Thermoelectric coupling coefficients measured in the laboratory on samples of reservoir rock are not large enough to explain the −340 ± 40 mV source intensity predicted by the model, possibly because the laboratory measurements were made at temperatures about 300°C lower than the reservoir value. These results do not rule out the possibility of a streaming potential source mechanism.",10.1190/1.1441361
Finite‐Difference Modeling In Transversely Isotropic Media,"We developed a modeling algorithm for transversely isotropic media that uses finite‐difference operators in a staggered grid. Staggered grid schemes are more stable than the conventional finite‐difference methods because the differences are actually based on half the grid spacing. This modeling algorithm uses the full elastic wave equation that makes possible the modeling of all kinds of waves propagating in transversely isotropic media. The spatial derivatives are represented by fourth‐order, finite‐difference operators while the time derivative is represented by a secondorder, finite‐difference operator. The algorithm has no limitation on the acquisition geometry or on the heterogeneity of the media. The program is currently formulated to work in a 2-D transversely isotropic medium but can readily be extended to 3-D. Snapshots can be obtained at any time with no additional computational cost. A four‐layer model is used to show the usefulness of the method. Horizontal and vertical component seismograms are modeled in transversely isotropic media and compared with seismograms modeled in the corresponding isotropic media.",10.1190/1.1443590
A Least‐Squares Minimization Approach To Shape Determination From Gravity Data,"The gravity anomaly expression produced by most geologic structures can be represented by a continuous function of both shape (shape‐factor) and depth‐related variables with an amplitude coefficient related to mass (Abdelrahman and El‐Araby, 1993). Few methods have been developed to determine the shape of the buried geologic structure from residual gravity anomaly profiles. These methods include a Walsh transform approach (Shaw and Agarwal, 1990) and the employment of a correlation factor between successive least‐squares residuals (Abdelrahman and El‐Araby 1993). In the present note, a least‐squares minimization approach to shape‐factor determination from a residual gravity anomaly profile is presented. The problem of the shape‐factor determination is transformed into the problem of finding a solution of a nonlinear equation of the form f(q) = 0.",10.1190/1.1443797
Wave‐Field Extrapolation By The Linearly Transformed Wave Equation,"Many approximations to different order of the one‐way scalar wave equation have been suggested in seismic imaging or modeling. Of these approximations, the first‐order approximation, usually called the 15‐degree equation, is most commonly used in industry because of its high efficiency. However, one common constraint of all these approximations is that they cannot handle large‐angle events exactly. Through a linear transformation of the wave equation, the LInearly Transformed Wave EQuation (LITWEQ) is obtainable, without approximation. The LITWEQ has the form of the 15‐degree equation. The solution to the LITWEQ is still a two‐way wave solution. By imposing the boundary condition for upcoming (or downgoing) waves, the LITWEQ can be applied to seismic imaging (or modeling). Implementing the LITWEQ with a finite‐differencing algorithm gives a 180‐degree, or all‐dip, finite‐difference wave‐extrapolation operator, which solves the angle limitation problem of conventional finite‐difference methods.",10.1190/1.1442204
Seismic Wave Propagation In Porous Granular Media,"Theoretical and experimental studies have been made of the manner in which sound waves are propagated in porous granular aggregates. A cylindrical piezo‐electric source is used and this simulates the explosion of a charge in a seismic shot‐hole. It is found that in general two waves of volume expansion are propagated and that these involve coupled displacements of both constituents of the media. The waves are termed frame‐waves, air‐waves or liquid‐waves depending upon the nature of the pore‐filler and the relative displacements of the constituents. The frame‐wave velocity is dependent upon the strength of the frame, the densities of solid and pore‐filling materials and the texture of the medium. Air‐ and liquid‐wave velocities are related to the texture of the medium and to the density and viscosity of the pore‐filler. Frame‐strength is important to a lesser degree. Waves are dispersive only in the case of media of very low permeability. Attenuation is related to viscosity, texture and frequency. Scattering is probably important only at the highest frequencies and largest particle diameters used in the experiments. It is shown that porosity and permeability of a beach sand can be inferred from velocity measurements. These properties provide information regarding grain‐size, sorting and the nature of the pore‐filler.",10.1190/1.1438261
Exploration Geophysics At The Pyhäsalmi Mine And Grade Control Work Of The Outokumpu Group,"The power of geophysics is often realized while surveying barren exploration holes. Integrated interpretation of borehole electromagnetic (EM) and lithogeochemical data led to the discovery of a new volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) ore deposit at 500 m depth in the Pyhäsalmi area, which belongs to the Main Sulfide ore belt in Finland. In the deep exploration program, wide‐band multifrequency EM ground surveys were successfully used to detect both new ore lenses and geological structures. Mise‐a‐la‐masse (MAM) borehole and ground surveys as well as borehole EM surveys were effectively used to correlate intersections between drill holes and to locate new orebodies. The latest modeling of MAM data resulted in an exploration target at 700 m depth. The use of geophysics for exploration has been extended to mine production at Outokumpu. Geophysical logging detects ore‐waste boundaries, reduces expensive core drilling, and obtains physical property information quickly on ore intersections. Depending on ore type, geophysical borehole logging can also be applied to classify mineralization, interpret lithology, and sometimes to transform physical responses to metal grades in ore. At the Pyhäsalmi zinc‐copper‐sulfur mine, density logging in percussion boreholes is used to locate mineable ore boundaries and to classify drillhole intersections as massive or semimassive sulfide ore types. Pyrrhotite‐bearing zones are separated from other sulfides by inductive conductivity logs. The use of geophysical logging for grade estimation and control has been most effective in the nickel mines at Enonkoski, Finland, and Namew Lake, Canada (using conductivity logs), and in the Kemi chromium mine, Finland (using gamma‐gamma density logs).",10.1190/1.1444879
Source‐Independent Full‐Waveform Inversion Of Seismic Data,"A rigorous full‐waveform inversion of seismic data has been a challenging subject, partly because of the lack of precise knowledge of the source. Since currently available approaches involve some form of approximations to the source, inversion results are subject to the quality and choice of the source information used. We propose a new full‐waveform inversion methodology that does not involve source spectrum information. Thus, potential inversion errors from source estimation can be eliminated. A gather of seismic traces is first Fourier transformed into the frequency domain, and a normalized wavefield is obtained for each trace in the frequency domain. Normalization is done with respect to the frequency response of a reference trace selected from the gather, so the complex‐valued normalized wavefield is dimensionless. The source spectrum is eliminated during the normalization procedure. With its source spectrum eliminated, the normalized wavefield lets us construct an inversion algorithm without the source information. The inversion algorithm minimizes misfits between a measured normalized wavefield and a numerically computed normalized wavefield. The proposed approach has been demonstrated successfully using a simple 2D scalar problem.",10.1190/1.1635054
Angle‐Domain Common‐Image Gathers By Wavefield Continuation Methods,"Migration in the angle domain creates seismic images for different reflection angles. We present a method for computing angle‐domain common‐image gathers from seismic images obtained by depth migration using wave‐field continuation. Our method operates on prestack migrated images and produces the output as a function of the reflection angle, not as a function of offset ray parameter as in other alternative approaches. The method amounts to a radial‐trace transform in the Fourier domain and is equivalent to a slant stack in the space domain. We obtain the angle gathers using a stretch technique that enables us to impose smoothness through regularization. Several examples show that our method is accurate, fast, robust, and easy to implement. The main anticipated applications of our method are in the areas of migration‐velocity analysis and amplitude‐versus‐angle analysis.",10.1190/1.1581078
Influence Of Inductive Effect On Measurements Of Resistivity Through Casing,"A conventional theory of electrical logging through casing, using an alternating field, is developed. Equations for the electric field and its derivative on the borehole axis are derived and their dependence on the resistivity of the medium and parameters of the casing are studied. It is established that within the low‐frequency part of the spectrum, formation resistivity can be determined using the theory of the transmission line. Measurements within the intermediate range of frequencies also give information about the formation resistivity and take into account changes in the casing parameters.",10.1190/1.1443954

An Efficient Algorithm For Computing Nearest Medium Approximations To An Arbitrary Anisotropic Stiffness Tensor,"The problem of reducing a fully anisotropic (triclinic) stiffness tensor comprised of 21 distinct components to a higher symmetry form having fewer distinct elements is of interest in many geophysical applications, where assuming a particular type of symmetry is often necessary to sufficiently reduce computational complexity to allow practical solutions. In addition, recent advances in the upscaling of realistically large field-scale discrete fracture networks have led to the need for an efficient way to derive a very large number of nearest medium approximations to the triclinic stiffness tensors obtained. Owing to rotational symmetries and nonlinearity, the problem of efficiently finding such approximations is generally nontrivial because optimal orientations are intrinsically nonunique. An algorithm proposed by Dellinger computes nearest orthotropic and transverse isotropic approximations for a given stiffness tensor, using the Federov norm as an objective function to iteratively minimize the fit error. Although this method is appropriate for computing solutions to single problem instances, the implementation is too inefficient for production situations, where a very large number of invocations of the algorithm is required. The enhanced algorithm proposed here is accurate, efficient, and general, allowing nearest medium approximations to be determined for arbitrary symmetry types, including isotropic, cubic, transverse isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic.",10.1190/geo2013-0388.1
Method For Depth Estimation On Aeromagnetic Vertical Gradient Anomalies,"The straight‐slope technique introduced some years ago by Vacquier et al. (1951) is employed to develop simple empirical procedures that can be used to determine depth to the top/center of anomalous sources on measured aeromagnetic vertical gradient profiles. Five geologic bodies/structures in the form of their magnetic/geometric model equivalents, namely, point pole, point dipole, finite dipole, dipping dike, and dipping contact are considered. From analysis of the normalized theoretical curves due to those models it is observed that the horizontal projection of the straight part of the steepest sections of each curve is insensitive to changes in the inclination of the Earth's magnetic field and also to the dip angle of dipping models. Further analysis of the curves using this observation leads to the conclusion that, when dealing with the interpretation of observed vertical gradient profiles, the length of the horizontal projection on a given profile must be doubled to obtain depth to the point‐pole, point‐dipole, or finite‐dipole source. For a geologic contact and a wide but shallow (i.e., the width more than twice the depth) dike, the length of the projection gives the depth for either source. However, a thin but deeply buried (i.e., the width less than twice the depth) dike, requires use of characteristic curves such as those developed in this study. Application of the procedures to observed vertical gradient results from the White Lake region of Ontario, Canada, has proven quite successful.",10.1190/1.1441974
Analysis Of Seismic Wave Dynamics By Means Of Integral Representations And The Method Of Discontinuities,"We analyze the dynamics (amplitudes and phase distortions) of seismic waves as they propagate along the ray. Our analysis is performed via a ray series approximation in the time domain. That is, we concentrate on characterizing the sharp changes (discontinuities) of the signal that are localized near the wavefront. After convolution of the terms of such a series with a proper temporally short (high‐frequency) wavelet, one obtains a synthetic seismic signal at a given point of interest. We present an outline of the proposed technique that yields integrals describing the wavefield. These integrals are similar to oscillatory integrals in the frequency domain. This description is uniformly valid near caustics, allowing the calculation of higher order terms of the ray series approximation. Practical use of the technique is illustrated by several examples which show two possible uses of the technique: general understanding of what is happening during wave propagation and practical calculations. First, we show how the structure of the ray decomposition changes near the simple caustic, and then we calculate a synthetic signal near the cusp caustic. The advantage of the technique is that the problem of seismic wave calculation is technically reduced to a problem of double integration of a Dirac δ-function; thus, it is computationally effective.",10.1190/1.1444932
From Tomography To Full-Waveform Inversion With A Single Objective Function,"In full-waveform inversion (FWI), a gradient-based update of the velocity model requires an initial velocity that produces synthetic data that are within a half-cycle, everywhere, from the field data. Such initial velocity models are usually extracted from migration velocity analysis or traveltime tomography, among other means, and are not guaranteed to adhere to the FWI requirements for an initial velocity model. As such, we evaluated an objective function based on the misfit in the instantaneous traveltime between the observed and modeled data. This phase-based attribute of the wavefield, along with its phase unwrapping characteristics, provided a frequency-dependent traveltime function that was easy to use and quantify, especially compared to conventional phase representation. With a strong Laplace damping of the modeled, potentially low-frequency, data along the time axis, this attribute admitted a first-arrival traveltime that could be compared with picked ones from the observed data, such as in wave equation tomography (WET). As we relax the damping on the synthetic and observed data, the objective function measures the misfit in the phase, however unwrapped. It, thus, provided a single objective function for a natural transition from WET to FWI. A Marmousi example demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach.",10.1190/geo2013-0291.1
A Numerical Study Of 3D Elastic Time-Lapse Full-Waveform Inversion Using Multicomponent Seismic Data,"A common assumption in wave-propagation problems is that the subsurface is approximately an acoustic medium. Under this assumption, important wave phenomena such as S-waves are not included. Due to the increase in computational power in recent years, the acoustic assumption may be left behind and replaced by the more physically correct elastic assumption. Time-lapse seismic data contain information about changes in the subsurface due to the production of hydrocarbons or injection of CO2. Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is an inverse method that can be used to quantify these time-lapse changes in the subsurface. Using a 3D isotropic elastic implementation of the FWI method, we studied two strategies for performing time-lapse FWI. We used synthetic ocean-bottom multicomponent seismic time-lapse data to estimate changes in the P- and S-wave velocity models. A sensitivity analysis in which the sensitivities with respect to the magnitude and physical size of the time-lapse anomalies and the noise level in the data was performed. The strategy focusing on explaining the data differences between the baseline and monitor data sets provided fewer artifacts in the inverted elastic models than the strategy that tried to explain the full monitor data set, and it was therefore preferable. The data-difference strategy depends on good repeatability in the time-lapse data sets and sufficient convergence of the inversion of the baseline data set.",10.1190/geo2014-0472.1
Multifrequency Turam Measurements Over A Sulfide Deposit,"A six‐frequency electromagnetic (EM) system has been developed and used for a Turam‐type survey over the sulfide deposit of Mailaram copper belt in Andhra Pradesh, India. Turam field strength ratio (FSR) and phase difference (PD) are measured in the range 84 to 2688 Hz. Sulfides in this belt occur as thin concentrated lodes which grade into disseminations. Soil covers a major part of the area. Interpretation of the results is carried out using a thin sheet model in free space. However, an attempt has been made to account for finite resistivity of the normal ground by computing Turam response of a conducting half‐space appropriate for the area and subtracting the same from the observed response. The results of the survey confirm the known advantage of the Turam method, viz., its greater depth of investigation compared to a method like Slingram. The normal ground at Mailaram is only mildly conducting so that the free‐air approximation is valid at low frequencies. A correction for the finite resistivity of the ground is required only at high frequencies. However, the limitation of a single‐body interpretation scheme for the bedrock conductor is well brought out by the results.",10.1190/1.1441265
The Reliability Of Geophysical Anomalies On The Basis Of Probability Considerations,"When data are used which contain random errors, there is always some question as to whether a supposed anomaly may not be real but due only to errors in the data. This paper describes a method of testing this point, which is worked out in detail assuming the Gaussian error law for the case of independent values. Possible applications of the method to the problems of contouring data, and evaluating and ranking anomalies are suggested. Examples of the use of the method on gravity and soil gas analysis data are also given.",10.1190/1.1441814
Magnetic Interpretation In Three Dimensions Using Euler Deconvolution,"Magnetic‐survey data in grid form may be interpreted rapidly for source positions and depths by deconvolution using Euler's homogeneity relation. The method employs gradients, either measured or calculated. Data need not be pole‐reduced, so that remanence is not an interfering factor. Geologic constraints are imposed by use of a structural index. Model studies show that the method can locate or outline confined sources, vertical pipes, dikes, and contacts with remarkable accuracy. A field example using data from an intensively studied area of onshore Britain shows that the method works well on real data from structurally complex areas and provides a series of depth‐labeled Euler trends which mark magnetic edges, notably faults, with good precision.",10.1190/1.1442774
The Effect Of A Percolation Threshold In The Kozeny‐Carman Relation,"One of the most important properties of reservoir rocks, and perhaps the most difficult to predict, is permeability. Laboratory studies have shown that permeability depends on a long list of parameters: porosity, pore size and shape, clay content, stress, pore pressure, fluid type, saturation—a nearly overwhelming complexity. In spite of this, the essential behavior can often be expressed successfully using the remarkably simple Kozeny‐Carman (Kozeny, 1927; Carman, 1937, 1956; Bear, 1972; Scheidegger, 1974) relation ",10.1190/1.1444251
Walk‐Away Vsp Using Drill Noise As A Source,"We describe a method for extracting and deconvolving a signal generated by a drill bit and collected by an array of surface geophones. The drill‐noise signature is reduced to an effective impulse by means of a multichannel Wiener deconvolution technique, producing a walk‐away reverse vertical seismic profile (VSP) sampled almost continuously in depth. We show how the multichannel technique accounts for noise and for internal drill‐string reflections, automatically limiting the deconvolved data to frequencies containing significant energy. We have acquired and processed a data set from a well in Germany while drilling at a depth of almost 4000 m. The subsurface image derived from these data compares well with corresponding images from a 3-D surface seismic survey, a zero‐offset VSP survey, and a walk‐away VSP survey acquired using conventional wireline techniques. The effective bandwidth of the deconvolved drill‐noise data is comparable to the bandwidth of surface seismic data but significantly smaller than what can be achieved with wireline VSP techniques. Although the processing algorithm does not require the use of sensors mounted on the drill string, these sensors provide a very economic way to compress the data. The sensors on the drill string were also used for accurate timing of the deconvolved drill‐noise data.",10.1190/1.1443863
Framework For Avo Gradient And Intercept Interpretation,"Amplitude variation with offset (AVO) interpretation may be facilitated by crossplotting the AVO intercept (A) and gradient (B). Under a variety of reasonable petrophysical assumptions, brine‐saturated sandstones and shales follow a well‐defined ""background"" trend in the A-B plane. Generally, A and B are negatively correlated for ""background"" rocks, but they may be positively correlated at very high VP/VS ratios, such as may occur in very soft shallow sediments. Thus, even fully brine‐saturated shallow events with large reflection coefficients may exhibit large increases in AVO. Deviations from the background trend may be indicative of hydrocarbons or lithologies with anomalous elastic properties. However, in contrast to the common assumptions that gas‐sand amplitude increases with offset, or that the reflection coefficient becomes more negative with increasing offset, gas sands may exhibit a variety of AVO behaviors. A classification of gas sands based on location in the A-B plane, rather than on normal‐incidence reflection coefficient, is proposed. According to this classification, bright‐spot gas sands fall in quadrant III and have negative AVO intercept and gradient. These sands exhibit the amplitude increase versus offset which has commonly been used as a gas indicator. High‐impedance gas sands fall in quadrant IV and have positive AVO intercept and negative gradient. Consequently, these sands initially exhibit decreasing AVO and may reverse polarity. These behaviors have been previously reported and are addressed adequately by existing classification schemes. However, quadrant II gas sands have negative intercept and positive gradient. Certain ""classical"" bright spots fall in quadrant II and exhibit decreasing AVO. Examples show that this may occur when the gas‐sand shear‐wave velocity is lower than that of the overlying formation. Common AVO analysis methods such as partial stacks and product (A × B) indicators are complicated by this nonuniform gas‐sand behavior and require prior knowledge of the expected gas‐sand AVO response. However, Smith and Gidlow's (1987) fluid factor, and related indicators, will theoretically work for gas sands in any quadrant of the A-B plane.",10.1190/1.1444406
Optimal Nonlinear Design Of Marine Borehole Seismic Surveys,"We explore DN-optimization, a recently introduced method in optimal experimental design theory, as a tool to minimize the forecasted postinversion model uncertainty in marine borehole seismic applications. The DN-criterion is a design objective function crafted specifically for nonlinear data-model relationships and, when used in conjunction with greedy, sequential optimization algorithms, is among the first of its kind to be computationally efficient enough for industrial-scale applications. The benefits and disadvantages of greedy algorithms are briefly discussed, and one of the most popular, the Construction algorithm, is confirmed to take (nearly) linear time, as predicted by theory. The DN-criterion is rederived here to show that restrictive assumptions in its original derivation were unnecessary. This new derivation is cast in terms of expected likelihood ratios, which quantify the discriminability of geomodels constrained by observed seismic data. A 3D vertical seismic profiling (VSP) survey and a walkaway VSP survey are DN-optimized for a site in the Gulf of Mexico, from which several potential applications are identified, including: (1) prescribing the maximum radius of 3D VSP spirals; (2) a novel annular-spiral 3D VSP geometry to reduce acquisition time and cost; (3) a novel azimuthal-walkaway geometry for presurvey acquisition; (4) identifying optimal data for rapid postacquisition quality control and quick-look inversion; (5) optimizing data decimation to facilitate the analysis of massive data sets which cannot be practically analyzed in toto; and (6) optimizing source vessel placement for offset/azimuth checkshots.",10.1190/geo2012-0265.1
Reciprocity Properties Of One‐Way Propagators,"Acoustic reciprocity is a fundamental property of the wave equation for the total acoustic wavefield (Rayleigh, 1878). In its most elementary form the reciprocity principle states that an acoustic response remains the same when the source and receiver are interchanged. In terms of Green's functions this reciprocity principle reads G(r2, r1) = G(r1, r2), with r = (x, y, z). For more general expressions and their seismic applications, see Fokkema and van den Berg (1993).",10.1190/1.1444473
3D Magnetotelluric Modeling Using The T‐Ω Finite‐Element Method,"We present a finite‐element algorithm for computing MT responses for 3D conductivity structures. The governing differential equations in the finite‐element method are derived from the T–Ω Helmholtz decomposition of the magnetic field H in Maxwell's equations, in which T is the electric vector potential and Ω is the magnetic scalar potential. The Coulomb gauge condition on T necessary to obtain a unique solution for T is incorporated into the magnetic flux density conservation equation. This decomposition has two important benefits. First, the only unknown variable in the air is the scalar value of Ω. Second, the curl–curl equation describing T is only defined in the earth. By comparison, the system of curl–curl equations for H and the electric field E are singular in the air, where the conductivity σ is zero. Although the use of a small but nonzero value of σ in the air and application of a divergence correction are usually necessary in the E or H formulation, the T–Ω method avoids this necessity. In the finite‐element approximation, T and Ω are represented by the edge‐element and nodal‐element interpolation functions within each brick element, respectively. The validity of this modeling approach is investigated and confirmed by comparing modeling results with those of other numerical techniques for two 3D models.",10.1190/1.1649380
Ridge Regression Applied To The Inversion Of Two‐Dimensional Aeromagnetic Anomalies,"The methodology presented was developed for processing and mathematical interpretation of aeromagnetic data derived from two‐dimensional sources. The inversion is based on the ridge regression technique as extended in Marquardt (1963) to nonlinear problems. The mathematical formulation provides a statistical approach for study of the efficiency of the solution. A procedure for data preparation is presented which includes a critical evaluation of the digital data obtained during the aerosurvey, joining of flight segments into a single line, and regional‐residual separation for profile analysis to set up the initial model approximation. The forward model is analyzed using predictive diagnostics called sensitivity coefficients and parameter correlation matrix. The parameter confidence intervals take into account the measurements of the nonlinearity of the quadratic approximation to the object function. The initial approximation is determined by profile analysis and by the geologic information that defines the forward model and its constraints. The nonuniqueness of the solution results in an interpretation that can be refined as new geologic information is applied for additional model constraints. Synthetic models are used to test and study the convergence and statistical properties of the solution, and to show the ability of the method to resolve anomalies due to various sources. The procedure is also applied to data obtained from aerosurveys over an oil exploration area of the upper Amazon sedimentary basin of Brazil. The validity of the solution is discussed in terms of its compatibility with the geologic information and constraints, and in terms of the statistical properties of the model parameters used to explain the observed data.",10.1190/1.1442000
"Elastic Finite-Difference Modeling Of Volcanic-Hosted Massive Sulfide Deposits: A Case Study From Half Mile Lake, New Brunswick, Canada","We present elastic finite-difference modeling results over a geologically realistic 2D representation of the Half Mile Lake volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposit, New Brunswick, Canada. The model is constrained by geologic information from surface mapping and boreholes, whereas petrophysical properties are provided by wireline logging data acquired in two boreholes intersecting different parts of the deposit. We analyzed the P-P, P-S, S-P, and S-S responses of the lower and deep mineralized zones and assessed some compositional effects by substituting massive sulfides with gabbro properties in the model. Finite-difference modeling results predict complex scattering signature associated with the lower and deep sulfide zones. Both zones scattered back P-P, P-S, S-P, and S-S waves generally having strongest amplitudes in the stratigraphy down-dip direction. The P-S, S-P, and S-S scattered waves, if properly recorded on multicomponent data, represent useful signal that could help the targeting of deep sulfide mineralization. Finite-difference simulations further reveal phase-reversals on P-P wavefields scattered at the lower and deep zones. The phase reversals are not observed for gabbro inclusions, suggesting that this signature could be used to discriminate gabbro units from sulfide mineralization. The finite-difference simulation successfully reproduces many events of the VSP data, in particular P-S and S-S events on the radial component and P-P and S-P events on the vertical component. Comparison with 3D data is rather poor and only shows weak correlation with P-P events from the lower and deep zones. Despite the poor correlation, a prestack time migrated S-P section displays an amplitude anomaly at the location of the deep zone, suggesting that S-P waves were recorded on the 3D data, although this survey was acquired with explosive sources and vertical geophones.",10.1190/geo2011-0445.1
Ambiguity In Geophysical Interpretation,"The question of uniqueness or otherwise of the various geophysical methods has been looked into from a general point of view. A method is theoretically determinate or indeterminate according as the totality of unknowns is smaller or greater than that of the independent measurables. While all natural field methods fall in the latter category, all applied field methods do not necessarily come under the former. Actual interpretations, however, cannot make any use of the theoretical uniqueness even where it exists and must depend on simplifying but permissible hypotheses based on extraneous information. These hypotheses are found to be surprisingly similar in all geophysical methods.",10.1190/1.1438985
A Simple And Accurate Discontinuous Galerkin Scheme For Modeling Scalar-Wave Propagation In Media With Curved Interfaces,"Conventional high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes suffer from interface errors caused by the misalignment between straight-sided elements and curved material interfaces. We have developed a novel DG scheme to reduce those errors. Our new scheme uses the correct normal vectors to the curved interfaces, whereas the conventional scheme uses the normal vectors to the element edge. We modify the numerical fluxes to account for the curved interface. Our numerical modeling examples demonstrate that our new discontinuous Galerkin scheme gives errors with much smaller magnitudes compared with the conventional scheme, although both schemes have second-order convergence. Moreover, our method significantly suppresses the spurious diffractions seen in the results obtained using the conventional scheme. The computational cost of our scheme is similar to that of the conventional scheme. The new DG scheme we developed is, thus, particularly useful for large-scale scalar-wave modeling involving complex subsurface structures.",10.1190/geo2014-0164.1
Modeling The Impact Of Wide-Azimuth Acquisition On Subsalt Imaging,"Wide-azimuth towed streamer (WATS) acquisition improves the subsalt seismic image by suppressing multiples, improves the results of 3D surface-related-multiple elimination (SRME) processing, and provides more uniform seismic illumination of subsalt targets. A simple model shows that the additional suppression of multiples in the case of WATS acquisition is the result of a natural weighting of the traces going into the stack due to the areal nature of the acquisition. This simple model also shows that the extent of the additional multiple suppression is strongly dependent on the acquisition effort. A sparse acquisition effort will result in little additional multiple suppression. The use of 3D SRME processing is shown to be more accurate in predicting multiples, given input data with multiple azimuths, compared to making similar predictions from narrow-azimuth data. Three-dimensional SRME has the potential to reduce the residual multiples to the same extent as WATS acquisition with a higher acquisition effort. A complex model demonstrates that WATS acquisition does reduce the multiple-generated noise in subsalt images, but 3D SRME processing further reduces the residual multiple noise. The use of 3D SRME may reduce the multiples more than that achieved by increasing the cable half-aperture in the WATS acquisition effort. Finally, ray trace modeling is used to investigate the effect of WATS acquisition on subsurface illumination for subsalt imaging. We show that narrow-azimuth acquisition produces irregularities in subsalt illumination perpendicular to the acquisition direction which are a potential cause of migration noise. WATS acquisition results in higher and more uniform subsalt illumination and, hence, improves the subsalt image by reducing subsalt migration noise.",10.1190/1.2736516
"Inversion Of Multicomponent, Multiazimuth, Walkaway Vsp Data For The Stiffness Tensor","We discuss three different scenarios of inverting noise‐contaminated data. First, we assume that the layers are horizontal and laterally homogeneous so that the horizontal slownesses measured at the surface are preserved at the receiver locations. This leads to a linear inversion scheme for the elastic stiffness tensor c. Second, if the S‐wave horizontal slowness at the receiver location is unknown, the elastic tensor c can be estimated in a nonlinear fashion simultaneously with obtaining the horizontal slowness components of S‐waves. The third scenario includes the nonlinear inversion for c using only the vertical slowness components and the polarization vectors of P‐ and S‐waves. We find the inversion to be stable and robust for the first and second scenarios. In contrast, errors in the estimated stiffnesses increase substantially when the horizontal slowness components of both P‐ and S‐waves are unknown. We apply our methodology to a multiazimuth, multicomponent VSP data set acquired in Vacuum field, New Mexico, and show that the medium at the receiver level can be approximated by an azimuthally rotated orthorhombic model.",10.1190/1.1581073
Migration Velocity Analysis With The Kirchhoff Integral,"To obtain accurate migration velocities, we must estimate the velocity at migrated depth points. Wavefront focusing analysis with downward continuation yields the rms velocity at migrated depth points; however, the large amount of computation required for downward continuation limits use of this approach for routine processing. The purpose of this paper is to present an implementation of the Kirchhoff integral which makes the wavefront focusing analysis practical for time‐migration velocity analysis. Downward continuation focuses the wavefront to the zero offset at the depth controlled by the velocity used for the continuation. The migration velocity is then determined from the depth where the focused wavefront attains the maximum amplitude. The flexibility of the Kirchhoff integral allows us to compute only the zero‐offset trace at each depth point and lets us avoid most of the computation for the downward continuation of unstacked data. Furthermore, since the velocity is obtained from the location where the focused wavefront shows the maximum amplitude, prestack time migration with the velocity from this technique produces the maximum amplitude for the subsurface reflector.",10.1190/1.1443051
Studies Of Elastic Wave Attenuation In Porous Media,"Elastic wave attenuation in porous media is due in part to the relative motion of the liquid and the solid. Biot's theory expresses this component in terms of permeability, fluid viscosity, frequency, and the elastic constants of the material. Experiments were performed to measure attenuation in the frequency range f 20,000 cps by a resonant bar method; attempts to measure attenuation at very high frequencies gave more equivocal results. Alundum bars were used to test the validity of the theory, for with these the loss not due to fluid motion is relatively small. Experiments were also made with natural specimens of rock. These showed that when not subjected to compacting pressure both the velocities and decrements of specimens were affected chemically and physically by the presence of liquid pore saturants. It is concluded that Biot's theory seems generally applicable to the determination of the fluid‐solid or ""sloshing"" losses in resonated porous media. There is still some doubt about the applicability of the theory in the case of measurements made by pulse techniques. The use of attenuation measurements as a logging technique, possibly to estimate permeability, is also discussed.",10.1190/1.1439063
Qvoa Analysis: P-Wave Attenuation Anisotropy For Fracture Characterization,"This paper investigates  Q -anisotropy for characterizing fractured reservoirs — specifically, the variation of the seismic quality factor  Q  versus offset and azimuth (QVOA). We derive an analytical expression for P-wave attenuation in a transversely isotropic medium with horizontal symmetry axis (HTI) and provide a method (QVOA) for estimating fracture direction from azimuthally varying  Q  in PP-wave reflection data. The QVOA formula is similar to Rüger's approximation for PP-wave reflection coefficients, the theoretical basis for amplitude variation with angle offset (AVOA) analysis. The technique for QVOA analysis is similar to azimuthal AVO analysis. We introduce two new seismic attributes:  Q  versus offset (QVO) gradient and intercept. QVO gradient inversion not only indicates fracture orientation but also characterizes  Q -anisotropy. We relate the  Q -anisotropy parameter  εQ  to fractured-medium parameters and invert the QVO gradient to estimate  εQ . The attenuation parameter  εQ  and Thomsen-style anisotropy parameter  ε(V)  are found to be interdependent. The attenuation anisotropy magnitude strongly depends on the host rock's    VS ∕ VP    parameter, whereas the dependence on fracture parameters is weak. This complicates the QVO gradient inversion for the fracture parameters. This result is independent of the attenuation mechanism. To illustrate the QVOA method in synthetic data, we use Hudson's first-order effective-medium model of a dissipative fractured reservoir with fluid flow between aligned cracks and random pores as a possible mechanism for P-wave attenuation.",10.1190/1.2194531
Pattern Analysis Of Seismic Records,"The three steps in automated analysis of seismic records are trace matching, event detection, and seismic zoning. Our algorithm matches traces by comparing sequences of peaks on neighboring traces and edits pairs of peaks identified as similar for consistency in trend across and down the record. By combining connected pairs, we obtain laterally coherent events of varying quality which divide a record into zones that may have lithologic significance. These zones can be obtained automatically by applying cluster analysis to seismic attributes and other discriminating properties of these events. On common‐shot gathers from a four‐fold survey in Saskatchewan, Canada, the coherent events which we detected this way are consistent with those recognized visually and are associated with clear formation boundaries. Strong reflections correspond to events detected with high confidence, and the seismic zones show good correlation among shot records. High detection confidence and good correlation indicate that the application of automatic analysis procedures to common‐midpoint gathers from surveys of higher multiplicity is possible and may lead to a new and quick way of obtaining velocity profiles. Zoning, if done properly, provides a compact description of seismic records that may simplify telemetry of large volumes of data.",10.1190/1.1442768
2.5D Resistivity Modeling Of Embankment Dams To Assess Influence From Geometry And Material Properties,"Repeated resistivity measurement is a potentially powerful method for monitoring development of internal erosion and anomalous seepage in earth embankment dams. This study is part of a project to improve current longterm monitoring routines and data interpretation and increasing the understanding when interpreting existing data. This is accomplished by modeling various occurrences typical of embankment structures using properties from two rockfill embankment dams with central till cores in the north of Sweden. The study evaluates the influence from 3D effects created by specific dam geometry and effects of water level fluctuations in the reservoir. Moreover, a comparison between different layout locations is carried out, and detectability of internal erosion scenarios is estimated through modeling of simulated damage situations. Software was especially developed to model apparent resistivity for geometries and material distributions for embankment dams. The model shows that the 3D effect from the embankment geometry is clearly significant when measuring along dam crests. For dams constructed with a conductive core of fine-grained soil and high-resistive rockfill, the effect becomes greatly enhanced. Also, water level fluctuations have a clear effect on apparent resistivities. Only small differences were found between the investigated arrays. A layout along the top of the crest is optimal for monitoring on existing dams, where intrusive investigations are normally avoided, because it is important to pass the current through the conductive core, which is often the main target of investigation. The investigation technique has proven beneficial for improving monitoring routines and increasing the understanding of results from the ongoing monitoring programs. Although the technique and software are developed for dam modeling, it could be used for estimation of 3D influence on any elongated structure with a 2D cross section.",10.1190/1.2198217
Limitations On Resistivity Methods As Inferred From The Buried Sphere Problem,"The study of resistivity surveys over buried spheres is facilitated by the use of a bipolar coordinate system. Without solving the incident potential problem exactly, the author obtains an exact solution for the apparent resistivity as measured by the Wenner configuration of electrodes situated directly over a buried conducting sphere. From a study of depth profiles over a set of spheres buried at different depths, it is concluded that one cannot expect to find by direct current methods a sphere buried to a depth greater than the radius of the sphere. This result is generalized to include bodies of more arbitrary shape.",10.1190/1.1437895
A Numerical Evaluation Of Electromagnetic Methods In Geothermal Exploration,"The size and low resistivity of the clay cap associated with a geothermal system create a target well suited for electromagnetic (EM) methods and also make electrical detection of the underlying geothermal reservoir a challenge. Using 3-D numerical models, we evaluate four EM techniques for use in geothermal exploration: magnetotellurics (MT), controlled‐source audio magnetotellurics (CSAMT), long‐offset time‐domain EM (LOTEM), and short‐offset time‐domain EM (TEM). Our results show that all of these techniques can delineate the clay cap, but none can be said to unequivocally detect the reservoir. We do find, however, that the EM anomaly from a deep, conductive reservoir overlain by a larger, more conductive clay cap is caused by the presence of the electric charge at conductivity boundaries rather than electromagnetic induction. This means that, for detection of the reservoir, methods such as MT, which rely on electric field measurements, are superior to those where only the magnetic field is measured. The anomaly produced by boundary charges at the reservoir is subtle and will be evident only if high‐quality data are collected at closely spaced measurement sites. LOTEM electric field measurements look promising and should be useful when efficient multidimensional tools are developed for LOTEM interpretation. Although CSAMT employs electric field measurements, this method is not recommended for reservoir detection because the anomaly caused by a deep reservoir is obscured by transmitter effects that cannot be isolated reliably. A combination of CSAMT and TEM measurements appears most appropriate for delineation of the clay cap.",10.1190/1.1443931
"Surface Ship Gravity Measurements On The Texas A. And M. College Ship, The ""Hidalgo""","Gravity meter readings taken at sea are disturbed by the motion of the ship and thus involve accelerations thousands of times greater than the permissible error. These accelerations must be averaged out and/or correction made for them. A meter which allows this to be done is described, and data obtained on a surface ship are presented with such checks as were available.",10.1190/1.1438587
"Layer-Induced Seismic Anisotropy From Full-Wave Sonic Logs: Theory, Application, And Validation","Thin isotropic elastic layering in the earth is one cause of seismic VTI anisotropy, along with intrinsic anisotropy and fractures. An important issue related to the routine use of VTI seismic data processing is the estimation of the necessary parameters. The full set of layer-induced VTI anisotropy parameters can be computed from full-wave sonic and density log data using Backus averaging. Intrinsic anisotropy can be incorporated if it is known from laboratory analysis. The isotropic layering method is applied to six wells in eastern Saudi Arabia, and the estimated anisotropy parameters are persistent across distances of many kilometers. This leads to the possibility of parameter estimation at sparse well locations for use in seismic data processing. Validation is demonstrated by direct numerical simulation of elastic wavefields in original and Backus-averaged earth models with various window lengths. We observe precise equivalence of the full wavefield when the averaging length is less than or equal to one-third of the minimum dominant wavelength. First arrival information, used in depth migration, is preserved with much longer averaging windows, up to twice the minimum dominant wavelength.",10.1190/1.2356997
A Least‐Squares Minimization Approach To Depth Determination From Moving Average Residual Gravity Anomalies,"We have developed a least‐squares minimization method to estimate the depth of a buried structure from moving average residual gravity anomalies. The method involves fitting simple models convolved with the same moving average filter as applied to the observed gravity data. As a result, our method can be applied not only to residuals but also to the Bouguer gravity data of a short profile length. The method is applied to synthetic data with and without random errors. The validity of the method is tested in detail on two field examples from the United States and Senegal.",10.1190/1.1443392
Cgg Method For Robust Inversion And Its Application To Velocity-Stack Inversion,"The modified conjugate gradient (CG) method, called the conjugate guided gradient (CGG) method, is a robust iterative inversion method producing a parsimonious model estimation. The CG method for solving least-squares (LS) (i.e.,    ℓ2   -norm minimization) problems is modified to solve for different norms or different minimization criteria by guiding the gradient vector appropriately during iteration steps. Guiding is achieved by iteratively reweighting either the residual vector or the gradient vector during iteration steps like the iteratively reweighted least-squares IRLS method does. Robustness is achieved by weighting the residual vector and parsimonious model estimation is obtained by weighting the gradient vector. Unlike the IRLS method, however, the CGG method doesn't change the corresponding forward operator of the problem and is implemented in a linear inversion template. Therefore, the CGG method requires less computation than the IRLS method. Since the solution in the CGG method is found in a least-squares sense along the gradient direction guided by the weights, this solution can be interpreted as the LS solution located in the guided gradient direction. Guiding the gradient gives us more flexibility in the choice of weighting parameters than the IRLS method. I applied the CGG method to velocity-stack inversion, and the results show that the CGG method gives a far more robust and parsimonious model estimation than the standard    ℓ2   -norm solution, with results comparable to the    ℓ1   -norm IRLS solution.",10.1190/1.2209547
The Production Of Elastic Waves By Explosion Pressures. Ii. Results Of Observations Near An Exploding Charge,A high fidelity recording system has been used to observe the elastic wave motion at vertical separations from an exploding charge ranging from 15 to 300 feet. The motion near the charge has a predominant frequency of about 1000 cps for rigid material and a duration of a few milliseconds. The motion becomes increasingly complex and low frequency components become dominant as the point of observation recedes from the source. A secondary wave which may be a bound wave associated with the fluid in the drill hole was observed.,10.1190/1.1445016
Estimation Of A Point Source Wavelet In Elastic Media,"A new method of wavelet estimation in elastic or acoustic media is presented. The method is based on the simple procedure of weighted summation of seismic traces for all the distances of source‐receivers, with a horizontal offset r as a weight. The model treated consists of a homogeneous elastic (or acoustic) layer with the free surface above and a half‐space below. The Lamé parameters and the density of the half‐space can be any function of the depth. A P‐wave point source operates in the layer, and the vertical displacement field or the vertical particle velocity field (or the pressure in the acoustic case) is measured by two horizontal lines of receivers located at two depth levels in the same layer. To obtain the wavelet‐estimation algorithm, the Fourier‐Hankel transform of the field is used. It is shown that there are two possibilities of data measuring: (1) when both the lines of the receivers are below the source and (2) when one of the lines is above the source. Numerical examples show that the proposed method gives a correct estimate of the source wavelet.",10.1190/1.1443503
Wavelet-Radon Domain Dealiasing And Interpolation Of Seismic Data,"Spatial aliasing is unavoidable in some seismic data and has serious effects on the performance of multichannel data processing and migration. Antialias filtering produces distortion of the signal through the removal of high-frequency information. In contrast, dealiasing produces an unaliased estimate of the signal at all frequencies present in the original time series. A new dealiasing algorithm is developed by exploiting the properties of seismic wavefields in the wavelet-Radon transform domain, specifically the overlap of information between wavelet scales at the same frequency. The effectiveness of the wavelet-Radon dealiasing algorithm is demonstrated through the processing of both synthetic and field seismic data.",10.1190/1.2422797
Traveltime Inversion Using Transmitted Waves Of Offset Vsp Data,"Estimation of layer parameters such as interval velocity, reflector depth, and dip can be formulated as a generalized linear inverse problem using observed arrival times. Based on a 2-D earth model, a computationally efficient and accurate formula is derived for traveltime inversion. This inversion method is applied to offset vertical seismic profile (VSP) data for estimating layer parameters using only transmitted first‐arrival times. As opposed to a layer‐stripping method, this method estimates all layer parameters simultaneously, thus reducing the cumulative error resulting from the errors in the upper layers. This investigation indicates (1) at least two source locations are required to estimate layer parameters properly, and (2) accurate arrival times are essential for computing the dip of a layer reliably. Bulk time shifts, such as static shifts, do not affect the parameter estimation significantly if the amount of shift is not too large. The result of real and modeled VSP data inversions indicates that traveltime inversion using transmitted first‐arrival times from at least two source locations is a viable method for estimating interval velocities, reflector depths, and reflector dips.",10.1190/1.1442920
Limitations Of Large‐Loop Transient Electromagnetic Surveys In Conductive Terrains,"Conventional interpretation aids used in transient electromagnetic (TEM) exploration assume that the anomalous response is due to induction in a simple model such as a plate, sphere, or uniform layer. Estimates of conductivity, depth, and size are based on analyzing the profile shape and transient decay constant. In regions with conductive overburden or conductive bedrock, TEM responses obtained with the large‐loop configuration can often be very dependent upon the location of the transmitter loop, and the results can be easily misinterpreted. A series of scale‐model studies was carried out to investigate the influence of current channeling and gathering phenomena with the large fixed loop and moving single‐loop configurations of the TEM method. Models studied included resistive and step discontinuities in a horizontal conductive slab, and a vertical plate in electrical contact with conductive overburden. Large TEM anomalies can be observed at the edge of a conductive unit, when diffusing eddy currents migrating through surface conductors are channeled and become spatially localized. Current gathering occurs when the diffusing eddy currents are gathered into a locally more conductive zone. The most common geometric condition under which these effects are observed is when a conductor of long strike length is located outside a large transmitter loop. The TEM response is enhanced by channeling and gathering, and it is often stronger than simple inductive effects. Current channeling and current gathering phenomena are relatively unimportant when measurements are made within a large transmitter loop, or when a single‐ or in‐loop configuration is used. It is therefore recommended that multiple transmitter loop locations be used when surveying in conductive terrains with the largeloop configuration, or alternatively that the single‐ or in‐loop configuration be employed for additional geophysical control.",10.1190/1.1441735
Time-Domain Inversion Of Gpr Data Containing Attenuation Due To Conductive Losses,"Many seismic data processing and inversion techniques have been applied to ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data without including the wave field attenuation caused by conductive ground. Neglecting this attenuation often reduces inversion resolution. This paper introduces a GPR inversion technique that accounts for the effects of attenuation. The inversion is formulated in the time domain with the synthetic GPR waveforms calculated by a finite-element method (FEM). The Jacobian matrix can be computed efficiently with the same FEM forward modeling procedure. Synthetic data tests show that the inversion can generate high-resolution subsurface velocity profiles even with data containing strong random noise. The inversion can resolve small objects not readily visible in the waveforms. Further, the inversion yields a dielectric constant that can help to determine the types of material filling underground cavities.",10.1190/1.2335518
Viscoacoustic Crosswell Imaging Using Asymptotic Waveforms,"We present a method to invert viscoacoustic waveforms. The waveform inversion is based on a new forward algorithm for waves propagating through viscoacoustic media. The algorithm represents the wavefield in terms of a summation over nonstationary raypaths. The amplitudes at the caustics are computed correctly. The inclusion of nonstationary raypaths makes it possible to compute sensitivity functions for both velocity and attenuation. The sensitivity functions lead to a linearized formulation of the waveform inversion. The inversion is applied to two 2-D data sets that previously had been matched using only velocity. The first data set consists of crosswell data obtained from a tank filled with a water‐saturated sand. The second data set was obtained after injecting a nonaqueous‐phase liquid into the tank. The inclusion of attenuation significantly improves the fit to the data, especially in the case of the second experiment. A misfit reduction of 80% was obtained, whereas the misfit reduction after inversion for velocity only was 40%. The Q values obtained for the two experiments (Q = 60–100 before the injection and Q = 10–20 in the second experiment) fall within the range predicted by other experiments.",10.1190/1.1444975
A Low Frequency Electrical Earth Model,"A general earth model is described which simulates the earth when excited by currents either conductively coupled to the earth by electrodes or inductively coupled to the earth by loops. Consideration of model equations showed that a material with a resistivity of approximately 10-4 ohm‐meters was desired for use in the model. Although suitable materials with this resistivity were not known, it was found that fine bronze wheel grindings held together by wax did have the required macroscopic resistivity. Using this model, surface measurements were made employing a modified Wenner spread ""one mile"" in length. Only minor anomalies resulted from a simulated salt dome ""three‐quarters of a mile"" in diameter and ""one‐half mile"" below the surface.",10.1190/1.1438195
Using High‐Order Cumulants To Extrapolate Spatially Variant Seismic Wavelets,Extraction of seismic wavelets is important for impedance inversion and forward modeling. We propose a method for estimating spatial variant seismic wavelets. The method uses third‐ and fourth‐order cumulants of seismic data. It combines third‐ and fourth‐order moments of seismic wavelets with those obtained by a deterministic method at well locations. We design a multidimensional filter at a well by matching the high‐order cumulants of seismic data to the high‐order moments of seismic wavelets. Applying the filter to the high‐order culumants of other seismic traces away from the well yields the corresponding wavelets. The new method for seismic wavelet extraction is thus constrained by well‐log data. Synthetic tests show that this method can produce accurate spatially varying wavelets. A real data test of the method is also successful.,10.1190/1.1527086
Muting The Noise Cone In Near‐Surface Reflection Data: An Example From Southeastern Kansas,"A 300-m near‐surface seismic reflection profile was collected in southeastern Kansas to locate a fault(s) associated with a recognized stratigraphic offset on either side of a region of unexposed bedrock. A substantial increase in the S/N ratio of the final stacked section was achieved by muting all data arriving in time after the airwave. Methods of applying traditional seismic data processing techniques to near‐surface data (200 ms of data or less) often differ notably from hydrocarbon exploration‐scale processing (3–4 s of data or more). The example of noise cone muting used is contrary to normal exploration‐scale seismic data processing philosophy, which is to include all data containing signal. The noise cone mute applied to the data removed more than one‐third of the total data volume, some of which contains signal. In this case, however, the severe muting resulted in a higher S/N ratio in the final stacked section, even though some signal could be identified within the muted data. This example supports the suggestion that nontraditional techniques sometimes need to be considered when processing near‐surface seismic data.",10.1190/1.1444434
A Generalized Maxwell‐Wagner Theory For Membrane Polarization In Shaly Sands,"The effects of charged clay platelets on the frequency dependent electrical properties of shaly materials are analyzed using simplified models for the membrane polarization around charged spheres immersed in electrolytic solutions, under a thin double layer approximation. The polarization is defined through two possible mechanisms: (1) a surface conductivity related with a modified Stern double layer model (S‐model) according to Schurr‐Schwarz theory; (2) a coupled electro‐diffusional mechanism occurring in a Guoy‐Chapman double layer using Fixman's approach (D‐model). By comparing the electric potential in such microscopic models with the external potentials derived for the equivalent homogeneous sphere using a Maxwell‐Wagner approach, we obtain the total current conductivity functions for these two models. The theory, therefore, provides explicit expressions relating the total conductivity functions to the model parameters. The behavior of the S‐model is described by a complex conductivity exhibiting a simple Debye characteristic. In the D‐model, both the conductivity and the dielectric permittivity are given as complex properties, showing similar but much wider dispersion than that of a Debye substance. Our representation of the grains and their associated ionic double layers by an equivalent sphere with effective properties allows us to extend our results to simulate rocks containing clays. This is accomplished using generalized mixture equations written in terms of the total conductivity functions. The frequency behavior of both models are compared and their fit to experimental data on clay‐water systems and shaly materials suggest that the D‐model is more appropriate for representing the dielectric behavior of clay bearing rocks. The theory can be adapted to estimate the clay parameters of a shaly sandstone using electromagnetic borehole measurements.",10.1190/1.1443257
Acoustic Waves In Sand-Screened Deepwater Completions: Comparison Of Experiments And Modeling,"Real-time completion monitoring with acoustic waves has been proposed recently as a method to monitor permeability changes along completions. Typical deepwater completions contain additional layers of sand screen, gravel sand, and perforated casing, which make them quite different from a fluid-filled open borehole. Monitoring changes in flow properties across the completion is crucial because impairment of permeability in any of these layers could cause reduced well productivity. In contrast to an open-hole model, a sand-screened completion supports two tube waves related to an inner fluid column and a gravel suspension in the annulus. To study effects of screen and sand permeability on tube-wave signatures, we construct simple numerical models of various completion scenarios using poroelastic descriptions of screen and sand. Models generally predict that a fast tube wave does not attenuate at either low or high permeability, but experiences resonant attenuation at intermediate frequencies. In contrast, a slow tube wave attenuates completely above a certain permeability value. Models provide a qualitative and sometimes a semiquantitative description for signatures of the fast tube wave. However, they are unable to explain why the slow tube wave is observed in experiments with high permeabilities of sand and screen. We speculate that a better model of complex sand screens is required to match experimental data.",10.1190/1.3002769
Physical Characterization Of Rock Masses Using Borehole Methods,"A convenient view of geophysical phenomena is based on the categorization of techniques according to the governing partial differential equation: the Laplace, diffusion, or wave equation. Each category is examined (nonmathematically) in the context of those borehole methods used to investigate large volumes of a rock mass away from the borehole in which the instrumentation is deployed. The published literature reflects the variety of applications, some of which occur more frequently than others. Our discussion of the physics focuses on electric‐potential, electromagnetic‐induction, and seismic methods, respectively, as representatives of each category. Choice of a single technique for characterization of rock masses involves a compromise which depends upon the geophysical problem and the type of information desired. The complementary nature of the information means, however, that integrated studies using two or more types of methods may be worthwhile.",10.1190/1.1441882
Fracture Parameter Estimation From Well-Log Data,"We evaluated a method of deriving seismic fracture parameters from vertical-well-log data with the assumption that the fractured medium is transversely isotropic with a horizontal axis of symmetry (HTI). One approximation we used is that the observed vertical P-wave velocity is the same as the background isotropic P-wave velocity of the HTI medium. Another assumption was that the fractures and cracks are noninteractive and penny shaped. Using these approximations, we generated the fracture compliance matrix for each layer. Fracture parameters were then derived by constructing the HTI stiffness matrix for those layers. We tested our method using vertical-well-log data from a tight sand reservoir in Colorado, USA. ""Thomsen-style"" parameters were derived, and gas-filled fractures were identified on this log. The identified gas-filled fractures were compared to the production log data. The fracture density was also obtained at the well location within the depth of interest. We also found some problems and limitations caused by approximating vertical P-wave velocity the same as the background isotropic P-wave velocity.",10.1190/geo2012-0407.1
Finite‐Element Analysis Of Controlled‐Source Electromagnetic Induction Using Coulomb‐Gauged Potentials,"A 3-D finite‐element solution has been used to solve controlled‐source electromagnetic (EM) induction problems in heterogeneous electrically conducting media. The solution is based on a weak formulation of the governing Maxwell equations using Coulomb‐gauged EM potentials. The resulting sparse system of linear algebraic equations is solved efficiently using the quasi‐minimal residual method with simple Jacobi scaling as a preconditioner. The main aspects of this work include the implementation of a 3-D cylindrical mesh generator with high‐quality local mesh refinement and a formulation in terms of secondary EM potentials that eliminates singularities introduced by the source. These new aspects provide quantitative induction‐log interpretation for petroleum exploration applications. Examples are given for 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D problems, and favorable comparisons are presented against other, previously published multidimensional EM induction codes. The method is general and can also be adapted for controlled‐source EM modeling in mining, groundwater, and environmental geophysics in addition to fundamental studies of EM induction in heterogeneous media.",10.1190/1.1444968
